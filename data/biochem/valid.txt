CONTEXT : beta cell proliferation is restricted to the perinatal period . Although cyclins trigger cell proliferation , their contribution to cell proliferation during the human perinatal period is not well understood . Furthermore , histological changes in the development of islet cells in Japanese are not well understood . OBJECTIVE : Determine pancreatic islet formation with cyclin involvement from the perinatal period to adolescence in Japanese autopsy samples . METHODS : Forty seven formalin fixed paraffin embedded pancreas sections from fetuses to adolescents were morphometrically evaluated . The expression of nuclear cyclins A2 and D2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry . CCND2 and CCND2 antisense 1 lincRNA were evaluated by in situ hybridization . RESULTS : alpha and beta cell proportions increased with development . The beta /alpha cell ratio was almost constant during development . beta cell proliferation , as revealed by labeling with antibodies against Ki 67 , was most abundant around birth and then rapidly decreased . The expression of nuclear cyclins A2 and D2 was highest around birth , and there was a stronger positive correlation between the Ki 67 index and cyclin A2 than D The expression of CCND2 antisense 1 lincRNA in pancreatic islets decreased rapidly after birth and correlated more significantly with cyclin D2 expression than with CCND2 mRNA expression . CONCLUSIONS : Our results provide the first morphological changes during the islet cell development in Japanese autopsy samples , ranging from fetuses to adolescents and that CCNA2 , assisted by CCND2 , may play a central role in beta cell proliferation . Furthermore , CCND2 antisense 1 positively regulates cyclin D2 expression in pancreatic islets of during development . These results could be applied to future beta cell proliferation therapies .
BACKGROUND : A detailed understanding of alterations in olanzapine pharmacokinetics during acute inflammatory states , associated with infections , remains lacking . This study aimed to investigate the impact of endotoxemia on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine and desmethylolanzapine ( DMO ) in mice . METHODS : C57BL/6N mice received an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS , 5 mg/kg ) or saline ( controls ) , followed 24 hours later by single oral or intravenous doses of olanzapine or intravenous DMO . Concentrations and unbound fractions of olanzapine and DMO were measured in the plasma and brain homogenates . RESULTS : In LPS injected mice , the area under the concentration time curve ( AUCs ) for olanzapine increased 8 fold in the plasma and 2 fold in brain homogenates , in consequence of a higher absolute bioavailability of olanzapine ( +200 % ) , a lower plasma clearance ( 34 % ) , and a higher brain penetration ratio for the unbound drug relative to controls ( Kp , uu , brain 2 vs . 1 ) . LPS attenuated the hepatic mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 1A2 and the metabolism of olanzapine to DMO . However , the AUC of plasma DMO increased by 140 % due to a 8 fold decrease in the plasma clearance of DMO . The brain penetration of DMO was minimal ( Kp , uu , brain </= 051 ) . The LPS injected mice exhibited a downregulation of the hepatic and ileal mRNA expression of P glycoprotein ( Abcb1a ) , whereas the expression of Abcb1a and Abcb1b in the brain were upregulated . CONCLUSION : Endotoxemia notably increases olanzapine concentrations in the plasma and brain following oral administration in mice . Further studies should clarify whether altered pharmacokinetics results in adverse effects in acutely infected patients taking oral olanzapine .
Prion diseases , also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( TSEs ) , are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that result from abnormally folded prion proteins . These disorders can be sporadic , acquired , or genetic . Acquired TSEs can be found in a number of animal species including sheep ( scrapie ) , cows ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) , and cervids ( chronic wasting disease ) . Chronic wasting disease ( CWD ) is unusual in that it is found in free ranging animals in their natural environment . There has been heretofore no reported cases of CWD being transmitted to humans ; however , the possibility of future adaption for human transmission exists . Several novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of prion disease in humans are under development , including knockdown of endogenous prion expression or overexpression of dominant negative prion forms . Here , I propose that CWD , as a naturally occurring prion disease , should be considered an important testing target for such therapies , which can demonstrate efficacy outside of controlled laboratory environments . Further , from the ethical standpoint of reducing animal suffering , decreasing the CWD burden in cervid populations is highly desirable . Finally , lowering CWD incidence can reduce future possibilities of transmission to humans or to other animal species . FAU Bordonaro , Michael
The goals of these studies were to test for errors in measuring the insulin concentration resulting in 50% suppression from baseline free fatty acid palmitate rate of appearance ( FFA ( palmitate ) IC ) when measured with a two step , euglycemic , hyperinsulinemic clamp ( EHC ) . We also determined the reproducibility of FFA ( palmitate ) IC in weight stable adults and assessed the magnitude of the change in FFA ( palmitate ) ICin response to weight loss . To accomplish this we analyzed data from 46 studies of 27 volunteers enrolled in two ongoing clinical research studies that included weight loss by lifestyle intervention or bariatric surgery . FFA palmitate kinetics were measure using an intravenous infusion of [U C]palmitate under basal ( fasting ) and a two step EHC . For 40 of 46 studies , calculating FFA ( palmitate ) IC using data from both steps of a EHC overestimated FFA ( palmitate ) IC compared with the first ( low ) dose , which suppressed palmitate Ra by > 50% . FFA ( palmitate ) IC did not change and was reproducible after 4 months ( r = 70 , P = 02 ) for 10 weight stable volunteers . Weight loss by either intervention reduced FFA ( palmitate ) IC and the reduction was correlated with fat loss and change in adipocyte size . We conclude that , although a 2 step EHC ( with an initial low dose ) allows accurate assessment of FFA ( palmitate ) IC , careful scrutiny of each set of study data is needed . These data will improve the ability of investigators to design studies that can detect small , but important differences or changes in adipose tissue insulin action . FAU Song , Yilin
BACKGROUND : Skin aging represents a para physiological process related to metabolic imbalances , inflammation , proliferative responses , and oxidative stress . Ending the cycle of inflammation , and oxidative stress represents a way to slow the effects of aging . STUDY OBJECTIVE : The aim of our study was to evaluate the benefits of supplements with an herbal mixture based on Venerinase and B group vitamins , Zinc , and Magnesium in preventing/reducing photoaging by means of objective quantitative analysis of visual skin features obtained by VISIA 2D and stroma and vascular characteristics measured by Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) . METHODS : A prospective clinical study was conducted in 40 participants . They were randomized 1 : 1 to receive the supplement ( Giovina ) or placebo . Assessments were conducted at Baseline ( T0 ) , after 2 months ( T1 ) , and after 4 months ( T2 ) . The primary endpoint was to obtain a significant improvement in facial photo/chrono aging in the treatment arm , as assessed through the evaluation of the Griffith scale . Secondary endpoints were to assess significant changes in skin aging objective features ( VISIA ) and Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) parameters . RESULTS : The treated group showed a significant reduction in the mean Griffith scale score from 5 at baseline to 76 at T2 ( 4 months ) ( p = 001 ) . A significant decrease in red areas and a borderline significant reduction in the number of wrinkles have been shown by skin aging objective feature calculation on VISIA 2D photographs . OCT analysis showed a borderline significant reduction in collagen density . CONCLUSIONS : The decrease in vascular pattern and collagen density suggests an anti inflammatory effect with a potential stromal remodeling in the treated group . This seems to be correlated to the reduction in wrinkles and facial redness .
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) is a fatal aging related disease characterized by aberrant lung remodeling and progressive scarring , leading to organ failure and death . Current FDA approved anti fibrotic treatments are unable to reverse established disease , highlighting the need for innovative therapeutic approaches targeting novel pathways and cell types . Mounting evidence , including our own , has recently highlighted the pathogenic role of aging related endothelial abnormalities , including vascular inflammation and oxidative stress , in the progression of lung fibrosis , offering new therapeutic opportunities to block IPF progression . Unexplored , however , are the modalities to restore vascular abnormalities associated with progressive lung fibrosis , representing a critical gap to effective treatments for IPF . In this study , we demonstrate that circulating extracellular vesicles ( cEVs ) isolated from young mice are capable of reversing the aging associated transcriptional alterations of the pulmonary vasculature , reducing transcripts associated with innate immunity , oxidative stress and senescence , while simultaneously increasing transcripts linked to endothelial identity . Using the bleomycin model of persistent lung fibrosis in aged mice , we then demonstrate that the pre treatment with cEVs improves the vascular response to injury and attenuates lung fibrosis progression , as demonstrated by reduced lung collagen content and preserved vascular network and lung architecture . These findings support the efficacy of interventions targeting endothelial aging associated transcriptional alterations , such as young cEV delivery , in mitigating pulmonary fibrosis progression in animal models of persistent fibrosis and indicate the potential benefits of combined therapies that simultaneously address vascular and non vascular aspects of IPF .

The restoration of milkweed to agricultural landscapes is thought to be essential for bolstering declining monarch butterfly ( Danaus plexippus ) populations . However , the rise of neonicotinoid seed treatments in recent decades has severely increased the toxicity of these landscapes for insects . It is therefore crucial that we understand how monarchs utilize neonicotinoid contaminated plants and their impacts on monarch health to better inform conservation efforts . We monitored monarch usage of milkweed ( Asclepias syriaca ) plantings adjacent to clothianidin treated and untreated cornfields and found both were utilized with equal frequency . We then examined how plant mediated larval clothianidin exposure affected monarch development , morphology , and energetics by tracking mortality rates , development times , body metrics , and metabolic rates across life stages . We found no difference in mortality rates or body metrics between the 2 treatment groups . Larvae feeding on clothianidin treated plants required less time to reach pupation than those feeding on control plants , but there was no difference in the time between pupation and eclosion . Larval clothianidin exposure did not affect the resting metabolic rates of monarchs at any life stage ; however , it lowered both the average and peak flight metabolic rates of adults , with the effects being stronger in males than females . These findings suggest that larval exposure to clothianidin contaminated plants can have carry over sublethal effects in adulthood , which may adversely affect flight capacity , particularly in males . Further studies are needed to elucidate the possible impacts on crucial aspects of monarch ecology , including their foraging , migratory , and reproductive potential .
OBJECTIVE : Antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) positivity has been observed in patients with steatotic liver disease ( SLD ) ; however , the link between SLD and ANA positive connective tissue diseases remains unexplored . We aimed to evaluate the association between SLD and risk of systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) , a representative ANA positive connective tissue disease . METHODS : A longitudinal population based cohort study using a Korean nationwide database was conducted . The analysis included 4 , 413 719 individuals who participated in a national health screening program in 2012 , with a mean follow up period of 21 +/ 05 years . Participants were categorized based on SLD status into four groups : no SLD , metabolic dysfunction associated liver disease ( MASLD ) , metabolic dysfunction and alcohol related liver disease ( MetALD ) , and alcohol related liver disease ( ALD ) . The main outcome measure was incident SSc . Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association between SLD and risk of incident SSc . RESULTS : Among the 4 , 413 719 individuals , 2 , 827 907 ( 07% ) had no SLD , 1 , 344 494 ( 46% ) had MASLD , 165 475 ( 75% ) had MetALD , and 75 843 ( 72% ) had ALD . Compared with individuals without SLD , those with MASLD ( adjusted hazard ratio [HR] : 612 [276 , 038] ) , MetALD ( adjusted HR : 575 [816 , 040] ) , and ALD ( adjusted HR : 063 [635 , 739] ) had a higher risk of incident SSc , with MASLD and ALD reaching statistical significance . The risk was the highest among individuals with ALD . CONCLUSION : SLD was linked to an increased risk of incident SSc . These findings underscore the need for effective monitoring and management of SLD , particularly by reducing excessive alcohol consumption , to lower the risk of incident SSc .
Insect development is mainly controlled by juvenile hormone ( JH ) and ecdysone , and their hemolymph titer determines the insect direction ; larva , pupa , or adult . The mediators of them are Kruppel homolog 1 ( Kr h1 ) , Broad Complex ( BR C ) , and E They activate genes that characterize larval , pupal , and adult feature , which gives rise to the metamorphosis . Before individual ecdysis , these master factors activate target genes to produce larva , pupa , or adult . Prothoracicotropic hormone ( PTTH ) from the brain activates prothoracic gland ( PG ) , resulted in the ecdysis . Other factors that activate ecdysteroid production are reported . The produced ecdysteroid was observed early stages of the last larval instar of Bombyx mori , where the ecdysteroid titer is different from previous stage . Two stages are different in JH and ecdysone titer , and the interaction of the JH and ecdysone production determines their titer . Ecdysone brings about the prominent change , which needs many gene transcriptions and the interaction of ecdysone responsive transcription factors ( ERTFs ) . Their target genes are successively expressed , which brings about the metamorphosis . For the activation of genes , ecdysone gives rise to chromatin remodeling and histone modification . Ecdysone and other factors bring about cell division of the wing disc of the last larval instar ; for the proliferation and differentiation , which gives rise to the growth and differentiation of the wing disc for the metamorphosis . In addition , hormone responsive miRNAs work , several ERTFs function for one gene , and the suppressive TF function along with metamorphosis . Thus , several attractive things underly around the insect metamorphosis . We will be near the understanding of the metamorphosis through these things .
Atherosclerosis is the primary driver of cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases globally . Atherosclerotic plaques have been detected in multiple arterial locations , such as the aorta , carotids , and coronaries . However , it remains uncertain if there are variations in susceptibility and association among arteries of different calibers . Utilizing a spontaneous rhesus monkey model of metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) , we assessed the susceptibility of atherosclerosis among the radial artery , femoral artery , and carotid artery and their correlation with coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . The development of atherosclerosis in the three arteries mentioned above was evaluated by Intima media thickness ( IMT ) and plaques using echo imaging over 6 years in a cohort of elderly monkeys with metabolic disorders . Coronary artery stenosis was assessed by coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) simultaneously . The diagnosis was further confirmed by histopathological examination , and RNA sequencing was employed to probe the transcriptional underpinnings of atherosclerotic development . The spontaneous development of atherosclerosis was observed in elderly monkeys , and the incidence of atherosclerosis was increased by three times in the MetS monkeys compared to the age matched control group . During the 6 year follow up , there was a notable increase in the IMT across all three arteries , with the radial artery showing the most pronounced thickening . Moreover , only the radial IMT correlated with CFR , suggesting its potential as a non invasive diagnostic indicator for CHD . Histopathology confirmed the findings by echo imaging and identified different extracellular matrix ( ECM ) remodeling patterns in the arteries . In addition , transcriptomic analysis revealed that ECM remodeling and inflammation related pathways were significantly upregulated in radial atherosclerotic samples , multiple inflammatory pathways were upregulated in the femoral lesion samples , and the carotid samples failed to enrich any pathways due to a lack of differentially expressed genes compared to the control samples . Non human primates , which share extensive genetic and physiological similarities with humans , develop atherosclerosis spontaneously . This provides an invaluable platform for investigating the intricate mechanisms of arterial disease and evaluating potential treatments . Using the monkey model , we identified the radial artery as a sensitive indicator for assessing the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis and coronary stenosis .
Embryo implantation is a critical step at the beginning of pregnancy , occurring during a specific and limited period known as the " implantation window " . Successful implantation involves various signaling pathways and molecular interactions . Recent studies have highlighted the importance of extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) in mediating these complex interactions . Different cell types release EVs to transfer signals to other cells or tissues . Additionally , emerging evidence suggests that EVs regulate signaling between the developing embryo and endometrium . In this review , we summarize current findings that highlight the role of EVs in the reproductive tract , gamete production , and their potential roles in embryo development and implantation . We then examine studies emphasizing the role of EVs in embryo maternal interactions and implantation . Finally , we will explore the theranostic potential of EVs in various aspects of assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) , including modulation of embryo maternal interactions , enhancement of embryo quality , and improvement of endometrial receptivity . A more comprehensive understanding of EVs in the pathology of recurrent implantation failure could support the development of personalized treatments .
Robotic bariatric surgery ( RBS ) is increasingly adopted worldwide . This study aims to evaluate the implementation and evolution of RBS at a high volume center over five years , focusing on operative time ( OT ) , operating room ( OR ) efficiency , and cost outcomes . A prospective analysis was conducted on patients undergoing elective RBS between July 2021 and March 2025 at ARNAS G . Brotzu , Cagliari . Metrics included OT , OR session time , and surgical volume . Variables analyzed included OT , OR session time , and surgical volume . Efficiency metrics such as overall OR efficiency , defined as OR session time/OT ( Eff1 ) , and robotic console utilization , defined as OR session time/console time ( Eff2 ) were derived . Cost analysis incorporated OR activation time , surgeon and material costs . Statistical analyses included t tests , Pearson ' s correlation , and linear regression . 100 robotic assisted procedures were recorded . Robotic adoption increased from 06% in 2021 to 98% in A learning curve ( LC ) was identified , with a significant OT reduction after the first 34 Roux en Y gastric bypass cases ( p = 001 ) . Full robotic manual anastomosis showed a notable cost decrease in later cases ( p < 0001 ) . Increased surgical volume correlated with both reduced OT ( r = 58 ) and improved Eff1 ( r = 49 , p = 005 ) . However , Eff2 changes were not statistically significant ( r = 31 , p = 09 ) , underscoring the need for team wide coordination . RBS in high volume centers enhance OR efficiency and cost effectiveness over time . The LC , surgical volume , and institutional workflows were key factors in optimizing efficiency , highlighting the importance of a collective LC for the entire surgical team .
BACKGROUND : With the increasing indications for fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of diseases , there is a growing demand for the preparation of frozen or lyophilized fecal microbiota products that are viable and can stably colonize the recipient . The addition of protective agents plays an important role in the preparation . However , there has been no systematic evaluation of the protective agents used in fecal microbiota sample transplantation preparation for transplantation . METHODS : We were used the donor bacterial flora containing 10 different formulations of protective agents were frozen , lyophilized , and stored . Plate counting , CCK8 assay , flow cytometry after LIVE/DEAD staining , and fluorescence intensity were used to assess viable bacteria in vitro . In addition , the donor bacterial flora samples containing different formulations protective agents were transplanted into antibiotic treated SPF mice , with 3 mice in each group and a total of 5 groups . Fecal samples were collected for metagenomic sequencing to observe the colonization of the bacterial flora in the recipient mice . RESULTS : The preliminary screening results showed that the survival rate of bacteria in the 5% trehalose ( T ) groups , and 5% sucrose , 5% inulin , and 1% cysteine hydrochloride ( SI ) groups was slightly higher than that in the other groups . SI groups tended to be more protective against anaerobes than T groups . The donor gut microbiota containing the SI groups protective agent exhibited the best colonization of the recipient mice . The protective effects of different formulations of protective agents on the colonized probiotic strains and the metabolic function of the bacterial flora in recipient mice were found to be species specific . CONCLUSIONS : SI groups can not only better protect the activity of anaerobic bacteria in the intestine , but also effectively promote the effective colonization of donor intestinal bacteria in the recipient mice , and the effect of frozen storage method is less , and can be used at the same time as frozen and freeze dried preparation . It can be used as a reference for the selection of protective agents in the preparation of fecal microbiota transplantation samples .
Previous studies have revealed that different intensities of exercise training have an impact on cognition . However , the cognitive effects of different intensities of exercise and its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood . The aim of this paper was to investigate the effects of different intensities of treadmill exercise on cognition in rats from the perspective of metabolomic analysis . In this study , ninety six male rats were randomly divided into four groups : control group ( CON group , n = 24 ) , low intensity running group ( LIR group , n = 24 ) , medium intensity running group ( MIR group , n = 24 ) , and high intensity running group ( HIR group , n = 24 ) . After 4 weeks of treadmill running , rats in the LIR group located the platform significantly faster than those in the CON ( p = 027 ) and HIR ( p = 011 ) groups . After 8 weeks of treadmill running , rats in the LIR and MIR groups also found the platform more quickly than those in CON group ( p = 003 and p = 015 , respectively ) . Additionally , rats in the MIR group showed significantly increased superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) /catalase ( CAT ) in the hippocampus compared with those exposed to HIR ( p = 03 ) , LIR ( p = 0008 ) , and CON ( p = 0004 ) . Metabolomic analysis revealed that , after 8 weeks of running , 14 metabolites with similar characteristics differed between the MIR and HIR groups compared to the CON group . The LIR group showed significant alterations in 12 key metabolites compared to the CON group . The LIR , MIR , and HIR groups also demonstrated significant changes in 3 , 4 , and 3 metabolic pathways respectively , when compared to the CON group . In conclusion , the above results indicate that LIR can effectively decrease fumarate accumulation , thereby enhancing the TCA cycle and brain energy metabolism which in turn improved cognitive function , while MIR can modify glutathione metabolism to alleviate oxidative stress ( OS ) , supporting cognitive function .
Diabetic nephropathy is recognized as the predominant cause of end stage renal disease worldwide . In reaction to metabolic stress , the peptide hormone spexin 14 , is synthesized in both central and peripheral tissues . Its level is reduced in type II diabetes mellites and may play a role in glucose metabolism . However , in the context of DN , the mechanisms through which spexin exerts its effects remain largely unknown . This research employed a rat model of DN to explore the therapeutic potential and the underlying mechanisms associated with spexin treatment . For the development of this experimental model , rats were subjected to an eight week regimen of a high fat , high fructose diet prior to receiving a single dose of streptozotocin ( 35 mg/kg body weight ) . Subsequently , spexin was administered subcutaneously on a daily basis for a duration of eight weeks at a dosage of 50 microg/kg body weight . The evaluation methods employed encompassed renal function assessments , macromorphological examinations , histopathological evaluations , and analyses of inflammatory and oxidative stress mediators . Additionally , immunohistochemical staining for NF kB and E cadherin , along with PCR analysis of mTOR , Bcl2 , and Bax gene expressions in renal tissues , were conducted . Following the administration of spexin to the diabetic rats , there was a significant reduction in serum levels of glucose , urea , creatinine , and inflammatory cytokines ( IL 1beta , TNF alpha ) , alongside a marked restoration of antioxidant enzyme activities . Furthermore , a significant decline in the levels of NF kappaB , mTOR , and Bax was noted and accompanied with increased expressions of Bcl 2 and E cadherin proteins . The observed improvements in histopathological changes significantly corroborated the biochemical results . In summary , spexin has proven to be effective in alleviating DN by its capacity to mitigate metabolic disturbances , oxidative stress , inflammation , and apoptosis .
Bio deposition of minerals is a prevalent occurrence in the biological realm , facilitated by various organisms such as bacteria , fungi , protists , and plants . Calcium carbonate is one such mineral that precipitates naturally as a consequence of microbial metabolic processes . This study investigates an innovative approach for MICP mediated heavy metal remediation , carbon dioxide ( CO ) sequestration by utilizing thermophilic microorganisms isolated from such geographical area which is not yet been subjected to any systematic scientific study . Beyond the well established urea hydrolysis pathway , this research highlights the contribution of non ureolytic MICP mechanisms driven by the oxidation of organic compounds within the bacterial extracellular polymeric substances and cell wall components of Bacillus licheniformis . Notably , both strains of Bacillus licheniformis redirect its great potential towards biocalcification yielding 36 +/ 8 , 21 +/ 5 mg CaCO cells/ml and 90% efficiency for heavy metal remediation with the formation of nanosized ( 85 nm , 58 nm ) biominerals . The influence of various parameters , such as temperature , pH , incubation time , CO concentration , and calcium concentration on maximum CaCO biosynthesis was evaluated . FTIR , XRD , and SEM EDX analyses confirmed characteristic peaks for both calcite and vaterite polymorphs , consistent with these Pb incorporation into the mineral structure , rather than surface adsorption is observed . These comparative findings provide valuable insights for promising bioremediation approach for the sustainable , eco friendly , energy efficient immobilization of metal contaminants and bio based carbonate production for efficient CO sequestration .
The endothelial glycocalyx is a dynamic brush like layer composed of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans , including heparan sulfate ( HS ) and hyaluronic acid ( HA ) , and is an important regulator of vascular homeostasis . Its structure ( thickness ranges from 20 to 6450 nm in different species ) not only provides a charge selective barrier but also serves to anchor mechanosensors such as the glypican 1 ( GPC 1 ) /caveolin 1 ( CAV 1 ) complex and buffers shear stress . In severe acute pancreatitis ( SAP ) , inflammatory factors promote the expression of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and heparinases , which degrade syndecan 1 ( SDC 1 ) and HS , while oxidative stress disrupts HA CD44 binding , leading to increased capillary leakage and neutrophil adhesion . This degradation process occurs before the onset of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) , highlighting the potential of the glycocalyx as an early biomarker . More importantly , the regeneration of glycocalyx through endothelial cell synthesis of glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) and shear stress driven SDC recycling provides therapeutic prospects . This review redefines the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis associated multiple organ dysfunction ( SAP MODS ) by exploring the glycocalyx ' s central mechanistic role and proposes stabilizing glycocalyx structure as a potential strategy to prevent microcirculatory failure .
BACKGROUND : Stress in childhood can harm brain development , leading to biological and systemic dysfunctions that , along with genetic factors , may contribute to major depressive disorder ( MDD ) in adulthood . MDD treatment is complex , with current drugs taking time to show effects and not working for many patients . As a result , medicinal plants , like Aloysia citriodora ( A . citriodora ) , are being studied as treatments for resistant depression . The main objective of this proposal was to evaluate the treatment with the hydroalcoholic extract of the medicinal species A . citriodora Palau on depressive like behaviors in rats subjected to chronic stress in childhood and on mechanisms involved in neuroprotection through the evaluation of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress . METHODS : The maternal deprivation ( MD ) protocol was used during the first ten days of life . At the beginning of adulthood , the animals were treated for fourteen days . At the end of the treatments , the animals underwent the forced swimming behavioral test and were then euthanized for analysis of oxidative stress and inflammation markers . RESULTS : The stress caused by the MD protocol in rats culminated in a significant increase in depressive like behaviors in adulthood , an increase in the expression of inflammatory substances IL 1 beta and IL 6 in the animals ' hippocampus , and an increase in the activity of oxidative stress parameters , such as myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS ) , in serum and hippocampus . The treatment with A . citriodora reduced depressive like behaviors similar to the group treated with escitalopram . Regarding markers of inflammation in nervous tissue , it was observed that animals treated with A . citriodora had lower levels than those treated with escitalopram and the control group , and even more significantly when compared to the MD group treated with saline . The treatments reduced MPO activity in the serum of animals that underwent the MD protocol . TBARS was decreased in the serum and ultimately reversed in the hippocampus . Moreover , molecular docking studies have demonstrated that baicalein and quercetin 7 O glucoside interact efficiently with IL 1beta and IL CONCLUSION : PM stress increased depressive like behavior and increased markers of oxidative stress and inflammation . Treatment with the Aloysia citriodora extracts significantly reduced depressive like behavior and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation , suggesting an antidepressant , antioxidant , and anti inflammatory effect .
The aim of the present study was to investigate how seasonal changes in the oxidation of biological energy substrates contribute to the thermal tolerance of farmed fish , as well as to explore the potential relationship between seasonality , metabolic pathways , and the energy reserves of a highly important aquaculture species , i . e . , the gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata . In a monthly basis collected tissue samples from a fish farm in Evoikos Gulf in Greece , RNA/DNA ratio was measured , representing a highly informative index of the nutritional condition and growth of fish . Additionally , seasonal variations in glucose and lipid metabolism were assessed through relative gene expressions of key metabolic enzymes and proteins such as glucose transporter ( Glu ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( L LDH ) , citrate synthase ( CS ) , 3 hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase ( HOAD ) , pyruvate kinase ( PK ) , AMP activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors ( PPARalpha/gamma ) . Furthermore , the expression of uncoupling proteins , NADH dehydrogenase ( NDH 2 ) , hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha ( Hif 1a ) , electron transport system activity ( ETS ) , and its components ( complex I + III ) was also employed as indicators of the respiratory chain activity . The findings reveal two distinct metabolic periods affecting productivity : a cold acclimatization phase marked by significant lipid accumulation and a warm acclimatization phase characterized by elevated carbohydrate metabolic pathways and enhanced corresponding enzymatic activities . However , the decreasing CS enzymatic activity during warm acclimatization may reflect the initiation of mitochondrial dysfunction . These metabolic adjustments underscore the fish adaptive responses to seasonal temperature fluctuations , highlighting their mechanisms of thermal tolerance and energy utilization . This understanding is particularly relevant for sustainability practices under varying thermal conditions .
Pterostilbene ( PT ) , a natural dimethoxy analogue of resveratrol , exhibits enhanced bioavailability and lipophilicity , making it a more effective therapeutic candidate than resveratrol . These pharmacokinetic advantages improve its cellular uptake and metabolic stability , positioning PT as a promising compound in cancer treatment . PT has shown significant anticancer activity in several malignancies , including melanoma , breast , colorectal , and ovarian cancers . Its mechanisms of action include induction of apoptosis through caspase activation , cell cycle arrest , and inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis via downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and vascular endothelial growth factor . PT also modulates epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications , and targets cancer stem cells by reducing the expression of stemness markers like CD44 and c Myc . Additionally , PT enhances the efficacy of standard chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin , doxorubicin , and 5 fluorouracil , with preclinical studies showing synergistic effects and reversal of drug resistance . A Phase II clinical trial ( NCT03671811 ) in endometrial cancer patients has confirmed the safety of PT and revealed its ability to modulate immune related gene expression and suppress mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling . Despite promising results , several challenges remain particularly low water solubility , limited systemic bioavailability , lack of large scale human studies , and undefined therapeutic protocols . Future research should focus on advanced formulation strategies , rigorous clinical trials across cancer types , and identification of patient specific therapeutic responses to support PT ' s integration into oncology practice .
To evaluate the predictive value of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio ( PLR ) in peripheral blood for assessing the treatment response to chemoimmunotherapy in primary advanced hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( HPSCC ) , we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients treated with neoadjuvant taxane platinum ( TP ) chemotherapy plus an anti programmed cell death 1 ( PD 1 ) inhibitor at Wuhan Union Hospital from Jan 2020 to Dec We collected data on absolute neutrophil , lymphocyte , and platelet counts from routine blood tested at baseline and within a week after the first treatment . A total of 35 patients were included in this study . Post treatment NLR ( r ( s ) = 445 , p = 007 ) and PLR ( r ( s ) = 475 , p = 004 ) demonstrated negative correlations with treatment response assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1 ( RECIST 1 ) . NLR and PLR were significantly lower in patients achieving a complete response than those not achieving it ( with p values of 04 and 02 for NLR and PLR , respectively ) . Among the 27 patients who underwent radical surgery following three cycles of chemoimmunotherapy , a high PLR after the first treatment was negatively correlated with attaining a pathological complete response ( pCR ) ( r ( s ) = 424 , p = 028 ) . For predicting pCR , the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve of PLR after the first treatment yielded an area under the curve ( AUC ) of 759 ( 95% confidence interval [CI] : 572 946 , p = 031 ) , with a sensitivity of 8% and a specificity of 2% . This research underscores the predictive value of the NLR and PLR in appraising not only the treatment response , as gauged by the RECIST 1 , but also the pathological response to chemoimmunotherapy in patients with HPSCC .

The current global obesity epidemic is often associated with changes in dietary habits and lifestyle . Increasing evidence from both observational and experimental animal studies has highlighted the relationship between prenatal exposures and an increased predisposition to metabolic and cognitive disorders , as well as obesity in adulthood . In this study , we used a rodent model to investigate brain energy metabolism by assessing mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and II , along with oxidative stress markers ( DCF ) and antioxidant defenses ( GSH and SOD ) , aiming to identify potential alterations in the central nervous system during offspring neurodevelopment . Our results demonstrated increased body weight and mesenteric fat accumulation in early life and adolescence , along with an imbalance in brain energy metabolism when maternal obesity and early life stress ( maternal deprivation ) were combined . By exploring the complex interactions between gestational exposures and long term behavioral and metabolic outcomes in an experimental model , our findings contribute to a better understanding of the developmental origins of health and disease .
Lung cancer is still considered to be the leading cause of cancer related death worldwide , and lung adenocarcinoma ( LUAD ) is the most common kind . KDEL Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein Retention Receptor 3 ( KDELR3 ) is a critical regulator of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress and the followed unfolded protein response ( UPR ) process , which are critical in tumor development . However , the role of KDELR3 in LUAD tumor progression remains poorly understood . In this work , we demonstrated that KDELR3 is significantly upregulated in LUAD tumor tissues and cell lines . Suppression of KDELR3 promoted the phosphorylation level of UPR related pathways , PERK , and EIF2alpha in LUAD cell lines . The downregulation of KDELR3 promoted ER stress induced cell apoptosis , decreased the protein expression of Bcl 2 , and increased the protein expression of Bax in LUAD cells . Moreover , the knockdown of KDELR3 inhibits LUAD cell invasion . In vivo animal experiments confirmed that the inhibition of KDELR3 suppresses LUAD tumor growth and metastasis . Mechanistic studies showed that transcription factor FOXM1 may serve as an upstream factor of KDELR The upregulation of FOXM1 increased the transcriptional activity of KDELR Further results illustrated that FOXM1 directly binds to the promoter of KDELR3 , thus upregulating its expression . Finally , rescue experiments demonstrated that FOXM1 inhibition induced cell apoptosis and invasion could be reversed by KDELR3 overexpression . Overall , our findings indicated that KDELR3 is transcriptionally upregulated by FOXM1 and accelerates tumor growth and lung metastasis in LUAD by inhibiting ER stress induced cell apoptosis .
BACKGROUND : Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) exhibits pronounced heterogeneity , which significantly limits the effectiveness of precision therapies . A comprehensive understanding of the biological characteristics and molecular mechanisms underlying HCC cell subpopulations is crucial for improving prognostic predictions and refining treatment strategies . METHODS : Single cell RNA sequencing data were obtained from the GEO database and processed using the Seurat R package for quality control , including data filtering , batch effect correction , and dimensionality reduction via PCA and UMAP to visualize cell distribution and identify distinct subpopulations . Cell types were annotated using established marker genes and literature references . The GSVA method was applied to evaluate the activity of 18 programmed cell death pathways . Cell developmental trajectories were reconstructed using Monocle 2 and validated with cytoTRACE to assess differentiation potential . Metabolic pathway activity was analyzed using the scMetabolism package . Bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA cohort were integrated to identify prognosis associated genes through univariate Cox regression . The malignant potential of tumor subpopulations was quantified using GSVA scoring . Weighted gene co expression network analysis ( WGCNA ) was employed to identify cuproptosis related genes . A risk scoring model was constructed using LASSO regression and multivariate Cox regression based on cuproptosis related genes and marker genes of cuproptosis characterized tumor cells . The model ' s performance was validated across TCGA , GEO , and ICGC datasets . Additionally , the relationships between risk scores , clinical characteristics , key signaling pathways , and immunotherapy responses were explored . Finally , a prognostic nomogram was developed to support clinical decision making . RESULTS : 12 programmed cell death pathways were enriched in tumors , with cuproptosis defining HCC , particularly in the C2 subpopulation . GSVA highlighted high risk patient enrichment in proliferation , DNA repair , and metabolism , reflecting aggressive malignancy . Developmental trajectory and metabolic analyses confirmed greater stemness and metabolic activity in C TCGA linked cuproptosis related subpopulations to poor prognosis . The risk model stratified patients ( validated in TCGA/GEO/ICGC ) , correlating with clinical grade , T stage , survival ( HR = 597 , 95%CI 051 289 , P < 05 ) . The nomogram showed strong predictive power ( C index = 716 ) , aiding clinical decisions . CONCLUSION : The C2 subpopulation represents the most malignant subset of HCC cells , with cuproptosis serving as a defining characteristic of this subgroup . The risk scoring and nomogram models based on cuproptosis related genes offer novel insights and a robust scientific foundation for prognostic prediction and personalized treatment in HCC patients . These findings highlight the potential of targeting cuproptosis and tumor microenvironment interactions to improve therapeutic outcomes in HCC .
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) exhibits a poor prognosis , particularly in advanced stages characterized by high recurrence and metastasis rates . This study investigates the role of lactate metabolism in HNSCC , aiming to develop a prognostic model to predict immunotherapy outcomes . Genomic and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases were analyzed , focusing on 233 lactate metabolism related genes ( LMGs ) . Differential expression and Cox regression analyses identified two significant prognostic genes : glycogen phosphorylase L ( PYGL ) and solute carrier family 16 member 3 ( SLC16 A3 , encoding MCT4 ) . A lactate risk score ( LRS ) model constructed from these genes demonstrated robust predictive accuracy across multiple validation datasets . Multivariate analysis validated LRS as an independent prognostic factor , and a nomogram integrating LRS with clinical parameters further improved survival prediction accuracy . Immune infiltration analyses revealed distinct immune landscapes between high and low risk groups . Elevated levels of CD4 naive T cells , resting NK cells , M0 macrophages , and activated mast cells characterized the high risk group , whereas naive B cells , plasma cells , CD8 T cells , T follicular helper cells , regulatory T cells , gamma delta T cells , resting dendritic cells , resting mast cells , and eosinophils predominated in the low risk group . Additionally , molecular docking suggested valproic acid as a potential inhibitor of MCT Immunohistochemical analyses showed increased PYGL and MCT4 expression correlated with advanced tumor stage , alongside decreased expression of CXCL9 and CXCL These findings highlight the critical role of lactate metabolism in HNSCC progression and immunotherapy resistance , identifying PYGL and MCT4 as promising therapeutic targets .
The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of partially substituting whole corn silage ( CS ) with sweet sorghum silage ( SS ) on serum metabolites in dairy cows employing by Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC MS ) . Thirty mid lactation Holstein dairy cows ( 112 +/ 04 days in milk ) were divided into the control group ( CON ) received 40% CS and 0% SS , Group1 received 30% CS and 10% SS , while Group2 received 20% CS and 20% SS , respectively . Serum samples were collected on day 45 of the formal experiment and subjected to LC MS analysis to detect metabolites . The results revealed that 29 different metabolites were obtained in both CON and Group1 ; however , 22 metabolites in Group1 showed up regulation compared to those in CON including N Methylhydantoin , Betaine , Isoleucine , etc . The levels of 7 metabolites , including L Kynurenine , Nandrolone , and Testosterone propionate , were found to be down regulated . Sixteen metabolites were detected in the serum of Group2 and CON dairy cows . Compared with CON , Group2 exhibited up regulation of 13 metabolites such as Benzaldehyde , Linoleic acid , Phe Glu . Conversely , three metabolites including Triglycerides ( TG ) , Uric acid and 5 Hydroxyindole 3 acetic acid showed down regulation . A total of 20 differential metabolites were identified in Group1 and Group Among these , 14 metabolites such as 2 Ethylacrylic acid , Succinic acid , and Glutamic acid were up regulated while 6 metabolites like Pyridoxine , Phosphocholine , and Quinidine showed down regulation . These differentially expressed metabolites are primarily associated with various pathways including Aminoacyl tRNA , Arginine , Phenylalanine and tryptophan biosynthesis , Citrate cycle etc . In conclusion , substituting up to 50% of CS with SS had no negative effects on serum metabolites , indicating that SS can partially replace CS in the diets of high producing lactating dairy cows without adding extra grain , when diets are fed for a short time under our feeding experimental conditions .
Liver diseases , such as hepatitis , cirrhosis , and liver cancer , pose significant public health challenges , ranking as the twelfth leading cause of death globally . Given the liver ' s critical functions in metabolism , detoxification , and biosynthesis , its impairment can lead to severe consequences , often resulting in end stage liver failure . Although liver transplantation is regarded as the definitive intervention for advanced liver disease , factors such as a shortage of donors and potential surgical complications necessitate the investigation of non surgical regenerative medicine alternatives .

It examines the contributions of various stem cell populations , including mesenchymal stem cells , hematopoietic stem cells , and induced pluripotent stem cells , in facilitating liver repair through mechanisms of differentiation and paracrine signaling . Furthermore , it explores the therapeutic potential of exosomes and conditioned media derived from stem cells as biotherapeutic agents in the context of regenerative medicine . By elucidating the mechanisms that underpin liver regeneration , this study aspires to inform the development of effective therapeutic strategies to address liver diseases and slow their progression . By elucidating the underlying mechanisms of liver regeneration , this study aims to contribute to the development of effective therapeutic strategies to address liver diseases and slow their progression .
Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) have emerged as a promising option for gene and cell therapy due to their unique biological properties . MSC based cell therapies have garnered significant attention for various clinical applications ; however , repeated administrations are often necessary to achieve sustained therapeutic effects . Genetic modification techniques have enhanced MSCs ' intrinsic capabilities , improving their therapeutic efficacy in both experimental and clinical settings . Key functional properties anti inflammatory , anti fibrotic , survival , and migratory capacities have become central targets for genetic enhancement . Numerous studies have explored the genetic modification of MSCs to address overcoming the transient nature of their therapeutic effects . Notably , the safety of genetically engineered MSCs remains a critical concern in preclinical and clinical investigations . In this review , we summarize current strategies for the genetic modification of MSCs and discuss recent findings on their application in animal disease models .
The cell wall of filamentous fungi is essential for growth and development , both of which are crucial for fermentations that play a vital role in the bioeconomy . It typically has an inner rigid core composed of chitin and beta 1 , 3 /beta 1 , 6 glucans and a rather gel like outer layer containing other polysaccharides and glycoproteins varying between and within species . Only a fraction of filamentous fungal species is used for the biotechnological production of enzymes , organic acids , and bioactive compounds such as antibiotics in large amounts on a yearly basis by precision fermentation . Most of these products are secreted into the production medium and must therefore pass through fungal cell walls at high transfer rates . Thus , cell wall mutants have gained interest for industrial enzyme production , although the causal relationship between cell walls and productivity requires further elucidation . Additionally , the extraction of valuable biopolymers like chitin and chitosan from spent fungal biomass , which is predominantly composed of cell walls , represents an underexplored opportunity for circular bioeconomy . Questions persist regarding the effective extraction of these biopolymers from the cell wall and their repurposing in valorization processes . This review aims to address these issues and promote further research on understanding the cell walls in filamentous fungi to optimize their biotechnological use . KEY POINTS : * The highly complex cell walls of filamentous fungi are important for biotechnology . * Cell wall mutants show promising potential to improve industrial enzyme secretion . * Recent studies revealed enhanced avenues for chitin/chitosan from fungal biomass .
A man living with HIV was found to lack expression of CD16A on his natural killer ( NK ) cells and monocytes . Genetic analysis revealed compound heterozygous deletion of FCGR3A , the gene encoding CD16A . The case ' s NK cells showed : ( a ) no antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity and very low spontaneous cytotoxicity ; ( b ) an immature phenotype marked by high expression of CD94 , CD2 , NKG2A , and NKG2D , and low expression of KIR2DL2 and CD57 ; ( c ) no expression of KIR3DL1 and very low expression of FcRgamma ; and ( d ) normal cytokine production . The case ' s monocytes and DCs were similar phenotypically and functionally to those from the donors matched for HIV status , age , and percentage of NK cells in the peripheral blood . In contrast to previously reported people with CD16A deficiency , this man did not have a history of severe infections with herpes viruses , suggesting that other immune cells and/or immunoregulatory function of NK cells may compensate for deficiency of cytolytic NK cells .
Vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF A ) is a key signalling protein that stimulates blood vessel development and repair . Its tight control is essential for organ development and tissue homeostasis . However , the complex regulatory network for balanced bioavailability of VEGF A is not fully understood . Here , we assessed the role of the glycocalyx component polysialic acid ( polySia ) for kidney development and its potential interactions with VEGF A isoforms , in vitro and in vivo , using mouse models of polySia deficiency . PolySia acts as negative regulator of cell adhesion , but also may interact with extracellular components . In murine kidney , polySia was identified on nephron progenitor and endothelial cell subsets in developing nephrons with declining expression during maturation . Loss of polySia in Ncam ( / ) mice revealed the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM as major protein carrier . Both polysialyltransferase negative and Ncam ( / ) mice displayed impaired glomerular microvasculature development with reduced endothelial cell numbers , reminiscent to the phenotype of mice with impaired VEGF A signalling . In vitro , immobilized polySia specifically interacted with the VEGF A188 isoform demonstrating an isoform specific direct interaction . Single cell RNA sequencing data analysis of newborn mouse kidneys implicated activation of VEGF A signalling in polysialyltransferase positive endothelial cells . Consistently , loss of polySia resulted in diminished VEGFR2 activation in perinatal kidney and human endothelial cells . At transcriptional level , the expression of polysialyltransferases and known polySia carrier proteins is conserved in human developing kidney . Together , these data demonstrate a direct impact of polySia on VEGF A signalling with the perspective that polysialylation could be a therapeutic target to ameliorate microvasculature repair after renal injury .
Trimming of beta ( 1 , 3 ) and beta ( 1 , 6 ) galactosyl residues from type II arabinogalactan side chains causes an increase in the methyl esterification degree of homogalacturonan in Arabidopsis seed coat mucilage . Arabinogalactan proteins ( AGPs ) are involved in various physiological processes , such as cell elongation , xylem differentiation , resistance to abiotic stresses or secretion and adherence of seed coat mucilage , a structure suggested as a model system for cell wall studies . The specific roles of AGPs are not fully established , although their carbohydrate motif ( type II arabinogalactan , AGII ) seems to be essential , being able to mediate interactions with different signalling molecules or with other cell wall polysaccharides . The aim of the present work is to determine the role of AGII from AGPs in the structural organization of the cell wall , using Arabidopsis thaliana plants that overproduce beta galactosidase betaV Gal from Cicer arietinum ( 35S : : betaV Gal plants ) , an enzyme that acts specifically on the beta ( 1 , 3 ) and beta ( 1 , 6 ) galactosyl bonds of AGII . The characterization of the seed coat mucilage has allowed us to establish a cell wall homeostasis mechanism in which the neutral side chains of the AGII of the AGPs determine the degree of HG methyl esterification . Thus , the reduction in the galactose is accompanied by an increase in the level of esterification , probably as a compensatory mechanism to maintain the mechanical properties of this specialized cell wall and its hydration properties .
Kidney diseases refer to a group of disorders that affect the structure and function of the kidneys , impairing their ability to filter waste products , excess fluids , and toxins from the blood . These diseases can be acute and chronic , and if left untreated , can lead to kidney failure . Their progression is closely associated with inflammation and oxidative stress . Key signaling cascades , such as TLR 4/MAPK and TLR 4/NF kappaB , are instrumental in fostering renal inflammation . Excessive ROS production worsens kidney damage , whereas activation of the Nrf 2/ARE pathway mitigates this by enhancing antioxidant defense . Moreover , the TGF beta/Smad pathway is heavily implicated in driving renal fibrosis , a major factor in disease progression . Additionally , elevated uric acid levels exacerbate inflammatory signaling , thereby worsening renal injury and dysfunction . Current treatments for kidney diseases have several concerns , including the need for routine monitoring , side effects , and long term regimens . Several natural compounds have shown promise in supporting kidney health by modulating these key molecular targets . Genistein is a naturally occurring isoflavone predominantly found in soybeans and soy based products , such as tofu , soy milk , and tempeh . It has demonstrated beneficial effects in various renal disorders , including both acute and chronic conditions , by regulating key molecular mediators involved in tissue injury , fibrosis , and cellular defense mechanisms . These mediators include TLR 4 , MAPK , NF kappaB , TGF beta , Smads , ACE , angiotensin , SIRT1 , Nrf 2 , ROS , SERBP , JAK/STAT and cytokines , among others . Considering the potential of genistein in modulating these mediators , the current review investigates the mechanistic interactions among these mediators in mediating its renoprotective effects .
INTRODUCTION : Esophageal squamous carcinoma ( ESCC ) is a common malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract with high morbidity and mortality rates . Lymphocyte activation gene 3 ( LAG3 ) , an important suppressive immune checkpoint in tumor immunity , exhibits a wobbling effect in the prediction of ESCC efficacy . METHODS : Tumor bite paraffin embedded specimens from 84 patients diagnosed with ESCC , all of whom received radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) at our institution , were screened . For each tissue , we delineated the partitions and analyzed the spatial distribution of the tumor in an in situ immune microenvironment . The density and regional characteristics of immune factor positive cells , together with the dynamics of various cells based on treatment regimens , were considered important factors influencing the prognostic significance of cancer . RESULTS : Compared with baseline tissues , the density of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the tumor microenvironment of the on treatment tissues decreased , but the expression of IFN gamma in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells increased . The density of LAG3 positive cells was correlated significantly with the density of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in both baseline and on treatment tissues . The density of LAG3 + T cells and the rate of LAG3 positivity in activated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were associated with elevated Ki67 expression . There was a significant correlation between high LAG3 expression and active CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in tumor cells . Elevated densities and tighter spatial relationships of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were associated with longer overall survival with ESCC . CONCLUSION : Concurrent chemoradiotherapy without combined immunotherapy inhibited tumor infiltrating T cells to a certain extent , and elevated immune checkpoint LAG3 was closely associated with immune activation in the ESCC tumor microenvironment .
This study assessed testicular function in children with cryptorchidism following different orchidopexy procedures by measuring serum anti Mullerian hormone ( AMH ) . The aim was to identify clinical factors associated with testicular function recovery by comparing pre and post operative levels of AMH , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , testosterone ( T ) , and testicular volume at various time points . This prospective observational cohort study included children aged 1 to 5 years diagnosed with cryptorchidism via physical examination and ultrasound . The study evaluated testicular function parameters before and after two different orchidopexy techniques , measured at five intervals . Serum AMH was the primary outcome , with FSH , LH , testosterone , and testicular volume as secondary measures . A control group of 57 healthy male infants aged 1 to 2 years was included for comparative analysis . A total of 138 patients were enrolled , with testicular function evaluated preoperatively and at 10 days , 1 month , 3 months , and 6 months post surgery . Preoperative AMH levels were significantly higher in unilateral compared to bilateral cryptorchidism ( P < 05 ) . Postoperatively , AMH levels increased by 3 months in children with palpable testicles and by 6 months in those with non palpable testicles ( P < 05 ) , with no significant difference between groups at 6 months . Cases with intraperitoneal release procedures also showed significant AMH increases at 3 and 6 months ( P < 05 ) , and testicular function improved similarly across surgical techniques . CONCLUSION : Orchidopexy can pose a risk of injury , emphasizing the need for careful treatment planning . While surgical technique did not significantly affect outcomes in children aged 1 to 5 years , serum AMH is a valuable tool for preoperative evaluation and prognosis in cryptorchidism . WHAT IS KNOWN : *Cryptorchidism impairs testicular function . *Orchidopexy improves function but varies by technique and testicular position . WHAT IS NEW : *AMH is a sensitive postoperative marker for testicular recovery . *Function improvement is consistent across surgical techniques , with intraperitoneal release showing significant AMH gains by 3 6 months .
Metagenomics has revolutionized enzyme discovery by enabling the study of genetic material directly from environmental samples , bypassing the need for microbial cultivation . This approach is particularly effective for identifying novel endolysins , phage derived enzymes with antibacterial properties suited for therapeutic and industrial applications .

Functional metagenomics , complemented by bioinformatics , enables the discovery and annotation of previously uncharacterized endolysins . Examples of endolysins discovered from metagenomics analysis are discussed . Despite the challenges of analyzing complex microbial ecosystems and isolating target genes , metagenomics holds immense potential for uncovering innovative endolysins , paving the way for developing new biotechnological applications . KEY POINTS : * Endolysins offer antibacterial potential for therapeutic and industrial use . * Metagenomics enables discovery of novel endolysins from diverse ecosystems . * Advances in tools and methods have accelerated novel endolysins discovery .
Emerging evidence supports that angiogenesis is essential for the wound healing of diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) , and high glucose ( HG ) induced dysfunction of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells is a key factor that hinders angiogenesis . However , the underlying mechanisms by which HG leads to the dysfunction of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells has not been fully elucidated . In the present investigation , we discovered a significant upregulation of the long non coding RNA GFOD1 AS1 ( GFOD1 AS1 ) in the ulcer margin samples of patients with DFU and the HG induced dysfunction model of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells , attributing its dysregulation to the stabilizing effect of NAT10 mediated ac4C modification , as corroborated by an integrated approach of data mining and experimental validation . Subsequently , a series of in vitro functional analyses showed that ectopic expression of GFOD1 AS1 promoted impaired function of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells . In contrast , knockdown of GFOD1 AS1 significantly alleviated the HG induced functional impairment in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells , as indicated by the enhanced cell proliferation , migration , and tube formation . Mechanistically , GFOD1 AS1 directly interacts with DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 to block its ubiquitin proteasome degradation , thereby enhancing the protein stability of DNMTThis stability elevates DNMT1 protein expression , ultimately inducing HG induced dysfunction in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells . In summary , our results reveal that GFOD1 AS1 serves as a potential therapeutic target for DFU , and highlight the critical role of the NAT10/GFOD1 AS1/DNMT1 axis in the dysfunction of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells in DFU .
In Alzheimer ' s disease , accumulation of amyloid beta ( Abeta ) peptide is thought to cause formation of neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein , which correlates with neuronal loss and cognitive impairment , but the mechanism linking Abeta and tau pathologies is unknown . Dystrophic neurites , which surround Abeta plaques and accumulate phosphorylated tau and other proteins , may play a role in seeding and spreading of pathologic tau . Here , we investigate the novel hypothesis that improved membrane repair capacity decreases dystrophic neurite formation by protecting axons from Abeta induced membrane damage . Using a ratiometric calcium sensor and a FRET based calpain cleavage sensor , we demonstrate that dystrophic neurites in 5XFAD mice have elevated resting calcium levels and calpain activity because of putative membrane damage . Annexin A6 , a plasma membrane repair in muscle and neurons , is present at plasma membrane of neurons and dystrophic neurites in murine and human brains . Overexpression of annexin A6 in brains of 5XFAD mice decreased size and quantity of dystrophic neurites and accumulation of phospho tau181 , an early biomarker of amyloid pathology . Phospho tau231 , another early amyloid biomarker , and phosphorylated of tau kinases , c jun N terminal kinase ( JNK ) and Calmodulin Kinase II ( CaMKII ) accumulate in dystrophic neurites in the brains of amyloid pathology mice and humans with AD , suggesting that dystrophic neurites are sites of active tau phosphorylation . Overexpression of dominant negative annexin A6 in 5XFAD mice increased dystrophic neurites and phospho tau Intracerebral injection of recombinant annexin A6 in 5XFAD and APP NLGF knock in mice resulted in localization of recombinant A6 to membranes of dystrophic neurites , suggesting therapeutic potential of recombinant annexin A6 for AD . In conclusion , dystrophic neurites have Abeta induced membrane damage characterized by calcium elevation , calpain activation , and accumulation of tau kinases and phosphorylated tau . Overexpression of annexin A6 reduces dystrophic neurites and phospho tau accumulation , suggesting that annexin A6 mediated membrane repair may represent a novel therapeutic approach for AD .
While metabolic dysfunction is linked to schizophrenia , the relationship between metabolic parameters , cognitive function , and psychopathological symptoms across different body mass index ( BMI ) categories remains inadequately understood . This study aimed to explore the distinct metabolic predictors of cognitive and psychopathological outcomes in schizophrenia patients stratified by BMI . A total of 1034 patients with schizophrenia were recruited and categorized into underweight , normal weight , overweight and obesity groups . Cognitive function was assessed using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status , and psychopathological symptoms were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale . Metabolic profiles and anthropometric measures were obtained via standard tests . Significant metabolic differences were found across BMI groups , except for low density lipoprotein . Underweight patients performed worse in language compared to obese patients , which had higher positive symptom but lower negative symptom scores . Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that in obese patients , elevated triglyceride was independently associated with better cognitive performance ( p < 05 ) . In overweight patients , waist hip ratio was significantly correlated with cognitive outcomes , which specifically predicting the severity of positive symptoms ( all p < 05 ) . In underweight patients , fasting blood glucose ( beta = 77 , p < 05 ) and triglyceride ( beta = 28 , p < 01 ) were associated with immediate memory deficits , while attention was negatively influenced by high density lipoprotein levels ( beta = 10 , p < 05 ) . Schizophrenia patients exhibit distinct BMI specific metabolic patterns that differentially predict cognitive and psychopathological outcomes , highlighting the importance of tailored metabolic interventions based on BMI stratification .
Immunotherapy targeting the programmed death ligand 1/programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD L1/PD 1 ) pathway exhibits limited effectiveness in individuals with recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) . Recent studies have noted that hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment ( TME ) triggers intricate interplay , termed " hypoxia induced exosome mediated communication " , between cancer cells and various immune cells . However , the role of hypoxia in modulating the immunosuppressive environment and its implications on the efficacy of immunotherapy in NPC remains poorly understood . In this study , we found hypoxia inducible factor 1 ( HIF 1alpha ) was positively associated with increased PD L1 levels and decreased CD8 ( + ) T cell infiltration , and correlated with a poor prognosis . Mechanistically , we demonstrated that hypoxia regulated the expression of PD L1 in NPC cells and their exosomes by activating the binding of HIF 1alpha to the PD L1 promoter . Meanwhile , using in vitro approaches , we found that macrophages could upregulate their PD L1 expression through the phagocytosis of exosomal PD L1 derived from NPC cells . Furthermore , we confirmed that PD L1 ( + ) macrophages could induce CD8 ( + ) T cell exhaustion and reduce their proliferation . In conclusion , our study revealed that hypoxia ( via HIF 1alpha ) upregulated the expression of PD L1 in exosomes derived from NPC cells , while macrophages induce the suppression of CD8 ( + ) T cells by phagocytosis of exosomal PD L Targeting the PD L1 ( + ) macrophages could potentially serve as a promising approach to augment the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade in NPC .
BACKGROUND : Histone deacetylases ( HDAC ) are involved in chromatin remodelling , and histone deacetylases inhibitors have become the interest of research and shown promising antitumor effects against various cancer . METHODS : In the current study , an attempt was made to characterize the preclinical ADME properties of a novel hydroxamic based HDAC inhibitor , PAT 1102 , with the help of in vitro assays and in vivo pharmacokinetic experiments in rats . RESULTS : PAT 1102 showed high aqueous solubility and high Caco 2 permeability in the in vitro assays . It was found to be not a substrate of efflux protein P gp , found stable in metabolism experiments with incubations of rat and human liver microsomes . Inhibition experiments of human recombinant CYP enzymes revealed that PAT 1102 was not considerably inhibited the major CYP enzymes . PAT 1102 exhibited low plasma protein binding of 1% and 5% in humans and rats , respectively . In vivo pharmacokinetic studies of PAT 1102 in male and female rats showed bioavailability of 7% and 0% by oral route , respectively . Previous research findings suggested that PAT 1102 is a potent pan HDAC inhibitor with good preclinical efficacy . CONCLUSION : Considering the overall ADME and pharmacokinetic profile of PAT 1102 , as indicated by in vitro and in vivo experiments , the PAT 1102 could be considered as a potential candidate for the advancement of cancer therapy .
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the role of tumor oxygenation imaging parameters in predicting the isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) mutation status in adult type diffuse gliomas . METHODS : This retrospective study included 296 patients with adult type diffuse glioma ( 237 IDH wildtype , 59 IDH mutant ) . The normalized cerebral blood volume ( nCBV ) , cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen values ( CMRO ) , capillary transit time heterogeneity , and oxygen extraction fraction ( OEF ) values from dynamic susceptibility contrast ( DSC ) imaging and ADC values from DWI were obtained from autosegmented tumor masks . Logistic analyses were performed in entire patients and in a subgroup of 46 patients ( 6% ) without CE tumors . RESULTS : In entire patients , 10th percentile of CMRO ( odds ratio [OR] = 64 , p < 001 ) and 10th percentile of OEF ( OR = 32 , p < 001 ) independently predicted IDH mutation , along with age , frontal location , presence of CE tumor , and 90th percentile of nCBV , with an area under the curve ( AUC ) of 92 ( 95% confidence interval [CI] 88 95 ) . In the subgroup of patients without CE tumors , 10th percentile of CMRO ( OR = 58 , p = 044 ) was an independent predictor for IDH mutation , along with age , and 10th percentile of ADC with an AUC of 94 ( 95% CI 83 99 ) . CONCLUSION : Tumor oxygenation parameters , including CMRO and OEF , may predict IDH mutation independently of previously known clinical and quantitative imaging data . Lower 10th percentile of CMRO and OEF predicts IDH mutation in entire tumors , while lower 10th percentile of CMRO predicts IDH mutation in patients without CE tumors . KEY POINTS : Question The role of tumor oxygenation imaging parameters for predicting the IDH mutation status in adult type diffuse gliomas is unknown . Findings Lower cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen values ( CMRO ) and oxygen extraction fraction ( OEF ) predicted IDH mutation in entire tumors , while lower CMRO predicted IDH mutation in patients without enhancing tumors . Clinical relevance Tumor oxygenation parameters derived from dynamic susceptibility contrast ( DSC ) perfusion imaging may assist noninvasive prediction of IDH mutation in adult type diffuse gliomas .
The FXR1 protein regulates the stability and translation of a number of RNA molecules and plays an important role in the regulation of cellular processes under normal conditions and stress . In particular , this protein is known to be a negative regulator of the key proinflammatory cytokine TNF alpha . We had previously shown that FXR1 functioned in the amyloid form in neurons of the brain of jawed vertebrates . Under stress conditions , FXR1 is incorporated into stress granules in some cell lines , but such studies have not been conducted for neuronal cells . Here , we showed the ability of the FXR1 protein to form cytoplasmic granules in a neuroblastoma cell line under various types of stress . This protein colocalizes with core proteins of neuronal stress granules upon heat shock and sodium arsenite treatment . We also showed that FXR1 colocalizes with anti amyloid antibodies OC under both normal and stress conditions . Given that stress granules are dynamic structures , we propose that amyloid FXR1 containing RNP particles interact with other stress granule proteins through weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds . Using a yeast model system , we found that FXR1 colocalizes and physically interacts with stress granule proteins such as TIA 1 , FMRP , FXR2 , and SFPQ . Overall , our results provide new insights into the role of the RNA binding protein FXR1 in neuronal stress response . We believe that FXR1 inactivation in neuronal stress granules can contribute to an increase in the level of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF alpha in neurodegenerative diseases . FAU Valina , Anna A
Biomarkers are defined as measures that indicate biological processes and responses to interventions . Spinocerebellar ataxias ( SCAs ) are autosomal dominantly inherited , progressive diseases . As targeted therapies for SCAs are being developed , there is a great need for biomarkers for use in clinical trials . Molecular genetic tests are firmly established as diagnostic biomarkers for SCAs . Biomarkers that monitor disease progression are needed in clinical trials that aim at slowing disease progression . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) volume measures and in SCA2 saccadic velocity are promising candidates , as they have been shown to decrease over time with larger sensitivity than clinical scales . Prognostic biomarkers indicate the likelihood of progression or a future clinical event . Potential candidates are CAG repeat length , blood neurofilament light chain ( NfL ) concentrations , MRI volume measures , magnetic resonance spectroscopic ( MRS ) metabolites , digital measures of gait variability and in SCA2 sensory nerve amplitudes . Response biomarkers , which are capable of detecting a response to an intervention , are essential for interventional trials . In gene silencing trials , the concentrations of the proteins encoded by the targeted genes serve as response biomarkers . To date , assays for expanded ATXN3 are available . NfL has the potential to serve as a response marker across all SCA subtypes , as it is assumed to indicate ongoing neurodegeneration , but available data are yet insufficient . Although development and validation of biomarkers for SCAs are rapidly evolving , there is an urgent need for further , longitudinal , multimodal studies .
The cotton fleahopper , Pseudatomoscelis seriatus , is a piercing sucking insect that feeds on several plant species , including squares ( pre floral buds ) of upland cotton , Gossypium hirsutum , causing square abscission and yield reductions . Current control of cotton fleahoppers relies on pesticide applications , but there is growing interest in using chemical ecology to develop more sustainable methods for integrated pest management . Herbivore foraging behavior is often mediated by plant produced volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) , which can serve as attractants or repellants during host plant selection . This study aimed to evaluate the influence of cotton fleahopper herbivory on VOC emissions from cotton squares under field conditions and to investigate the behavioral responses of conspecific insects to these VOCs . Using dynamic headspace sampling , we identified seven VOCs emitted from cotton squares , with three compounds emitted in higher abundance following cotton fleahopper herbivory : ( E ) beta ocimene , ( E ) beta caryophyllene , and ( E ) beta farnesene . The total emission of VOCs from squares with cotton fleahopper herbivory was greater than non damaged ( control ) cotton squares . Using dual choice olfactometer assays , we found that adult cotton fleahoppers preferred VOCs from non damaged squares compared to VOCs from squares with conspecific herbivory . Furthermore , cotton fleahoppers were attracted to synthetic ( E ) beta ocimene but repelled by synthetic ( E ) beta caryophyllene or the combination of ( E ) beta ocimene and ( E ) beta caryophyllene . Our findings suggest that cotton VOCs influence cotton fleahopper foraging , and that compounds identified in this study have potential for development as lures or repellants to use in integrated pest management .
Short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) are critical metabolites produced by gut microbiota that play a key role in modulating inflammation and regulating systemic immunity , including against cancer . Decreases in SCFAs can foster a permissive tumor immune environment . Recent studies have shown that cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) patients exhibit increasing gut dysbiosis and loss of bacteria predicted to produce SCFAs with increasing disease severity . To investigate this functional connection , we collected stool swab samples from 15 individuals 8 mycosis fungoides ( MF ) patients and 7 matched healthy controls ( HC ) and quantified concentrations of four SCFAs ( acetate , propionate , isovalerate , butyrate ) via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry . Our results demonstrated significantly reduced acetate and propionate concentrations in MF patients when compared to HC ( both p = 027 ) . Total measured SCFA concentrations were on average lower in MF versus HC , but did not achieve statistical significance ( p = 063 ) . Both propionate and acetate have been previously demonstrated to promote tumor apoptosis , inhibit tumor proliferation , and enhance antitumor immunity . Thus , dysbiosis associated reductions in SCFAs may be another contributive factor in the immune dysfunction observed in CTCL . Our pilot findings add to the growing body of knowledge implicating the gut microbiota SCFA axis in CTCL pathogenesis and offer potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention .
PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Plaque erosion is the second most frequent cause of acute coronary syndrome , yet the biological processes and biomarkers associated with erosion remain incompletely understood . This review aims to examine the current understanding of plaque erosion , with a focus on identifying potential biomarkers . RECENT FINDINGS : Recent studies have identified distinct pathophysiological characteristics associated with plaque erosion , including variations in inflammatory response and immune cell infiltration within the culprit lesions and thrombi . Additionally , differences in the expression patterns of specific molecules have been noted , suggesting unique underlying mechanisms that contribute to plaque erosion . Understanding the differential expression and role of immune cells and biomarkers in erosion may be crucial for developing targeted therapies . The identification of biomarkers may help in the early detection and treatment of erosion prone plaques , potentially reducing the incidence of acute coronary events .
Macrosomia ( birth weight >4000 g ) is a product of endocrine dysfunction in utero leading to fetal overgrowth and can lead to maternal and infant morbidity . Fibroblast growth factor 21 ( FGF21 ) and its transcription factor , peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha ( PPARalpha ) , are found in the placenta and are associated with abnormal metabolic states . Their relationship to the placental dysregulation that leads to macrosomia is unknown . We sought to evaluate the relationship between protein expression of FGF21 and PPARalpha in placental samples from infants with macrosomia compared to controls ( <4000 g ) on both the maternal and fetal sides of the placenta . Placental specimens were collected at the time of delivery and protein levels of FGF21 and PPARalpha were quantified via Western Blot analysis and normalized to GAPDH . Student ' s t test , Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test , Fisher ' s exact test , Chi squared analysis , and Spearman ' s correlation were used for statistical analyses . Baseline characteristics were similar across both groups . FGF21 and PPARalpha levels on the maternal side of the placenta did not differ based on presence of macrosomia . PPARalpha expression was statistically significantly lower on the fetal side in infants with macrosomia . In controls alone , FGF21 and PPARalpha trended lower on the maternal side compared to the fetal side although this was not statistically significant . PPARalpha and FGF21 were positively correlated throughout the placenta . We found that lower PPARalpha expression on the fetal side of placenta was noted in infants with macrosomia , identifying a possible contribution to the growth discrepancy in this group . PPARalpha and FGF21 are strongly correlated in the human placenta . FAU Harrison , Rachel K
Reliance on chemical fertilizers has significantly boosted food production in China , but it has also led to soil degradation , environmental pollution , and greenhouse gas emissions . To address these pressing issues , the Chinese government has launched various initiatives to reduce chemical fertilizer consumption and promote biofertilizers as effective alternatives to enhance soil fertility and mitigate environmental pollution . Biofertilizers promote crop growth by providing or activating essential nutrients , suppressing plant pathogens , improving soil health , and increasing resilience to abiotic stresses . The growing adoption of biofertilizers in China is reflected in the registration of more than 10 , 000 products , an annual production exceeding 35 million tons , and a market value of over US$5 billion , indicating a significant shift towards sustainable agricultural practices . Despite this progress , challenges such as the dominance of nitrogen fertilizers , inconsistent product performance , and the need for cultivar specific microbial inoculants remain . Foundational research on the microbial genera utilised in biofertilizers , including nitrogen fixing genera Rhizobium , Paenibacillus , and Pseudomonas , the widely used genus , Bacillus and Trichoderma , as well as multipurpose synthetic communities , is essential for overcoming these obstacles and enhancing the efficacy of biofertilizers . This review delves into the historical development of the biofertilizer industry and recent advancements in fundamental research on biofertilizers in China , highlighting the essential role of biofertilizers in promoting green agricultural development .
Yeast has been used in animal systems to modulate the immune response and support gut health . Certain amino acids ( AA ) are reported to also exert positive effects on the gut , supporting the intestinal barrier and restoring mucosal immune homeostasis . The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of brewers yeast on postprandial serum AA appearance in dogs . Nineteen privately owned domestic Siberian huskies and one Alaskan husky ( 9 females : 5 intact , 4 spayed ; 11 males : 3 intact , 8 neutered ) , with an average age of 8 +/ 6 years and body weight of 6 +/ 1 kg , were enrolled in this study . Ten dogs received a dry extruded control diet ( Ctl ) and ten the Ctl diet top dressed with yeast to receive a daily ss glucan dose of 7 mg/kg BW ( treatment , Trt ) for 10 weeks . At weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 postprandial free AA concentrations were quantified . A fasted blood sample was collected , a meal was provided , followed by further blood sampling 1 , 2 , and 4 h post meal . Serum IL 10 concentrations were analyzed from the fasted sample . All data were analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX of SAS , with dog as a random effect and week , diet group , and sampling time point as fixed effects for AA , and with dog as a random effect and week as a fixed effect and repeated measure for IL There was no effect of treatment on any AA , though a significant Trt*wk*timepoint interaction effect was observed for His and Trp ( P </= 05 ) . An overall increase was observed in many AAs for all dogs serum concentrations of Lys , Met , Thr , Trp , Ala , Arg , Gln , Gly , Pro , Ser , Tau , and Tyr were greatest at week 8 in all dogs when compared to concentrations at week 1 ( P </= 05 ) . Serum IL 10 concentrations did not differ by week or between groups ( P > 05 ) . In three Trt dogs that had greater gut permeability than all other dogs at week 2 , as reported in a previous publication , serum Ile , Thr , and Val concentrations were greater at week 8 compared to week 1 ( P </= 05 ) and Leu concentrations were greater 1 and 2 h postprandial at week 8 compared to the same time points at week 1 ( P </= 05 ) . The results of this study suggest that supplemental yeast may have a beneficial effect on peripheral AA availability without impacting inflammatory status in dogs . Future studies should seek to investigate the effects of reducing or improving gut permeability with yeast on nutrient digestive and metabolic efficiencies or consider yeast in clinical nutrition to support dogs with gastrointestinal diseases .
Ginsenoside compound K ( CK ) exhibits valuable pharmacological activity and has potential applications in the development of antitumor and immunity enhancing drugs . As a metabolite of ginsenosides in the gut , ginsenoside CK is generally considered a kind of non natural ginsenoside that cannot be synthesized in Panax species . In this study , necessary genetic modules for ginsenoside CK biosynthesis were found in Panax species , more specifically , in Panax japonicas ( P . japonicus ) for the first time . Based on the new findings , RNA sequencing was conducted on P . japonicus cells , and two UDP glycosyltransferases ( UGTs ) , UGTPj3 and UGTPj20 , involved in the biosynthesis of protopanaxadiol ( PPD ) type ginsenosides were identified . UGTPj3 and UGTPj20 can convert propanaxanediol to ginsenosides Rh2 and CK , respectively . Further analyses showed that UGTPj20 exhibited a lower affinity for propanaxanediol , compared with UGTPj Therefore , propanaxanediol tended to be converted to ginsenoside Rh2 by UGTPj3 , which led to the absence of ginsenoside CK in P . japonicus . Moreover , ginsenoside CK was successfully synthesized in P . japonicus cells with CYP716A53V2 and UGTPj3 RNA interference and UGTPj20 overexpression in this study . The titer of ginsenoside CK in the P . japonicus cell suspension culture reached 85 mg L ( 1 ) . This study has achieved ginsenoside CK biosynthesis in Panax species for the first time by regulating the metabolic pathway without introducing any foreign genes . The findings of this study also show that the variety of saponins synthesized by Panax species may be far richer than expected .
While cis peptides preceding proline can occur about 5% of the time , cis peptides preceding any other residue ( " cis nonPro " peptides ) are an extremely rare feature in protein structures , of considerable importance for two opposite reasons . On one hand , their genuine occurrences are mostly found at sites critical to biological function , from the active sites of carbohydrate enzymes to rare adjacent residue disulfide bonds . On the other hand , a cis nonPro can easily be misfit into weak or ambiguous electron density , which led to a high incidence of unjustified cis nonPro over the 2006 2015 decade . This paper uses high resolution crystallographic data and especially stringent quality filtering at the residue level to identify genuine occurrences of cis nonPro and to survey both individual examples and broad patterns of their functionality . We explain the procedure developed to identify genuine cis nonPro examples with almost no false positives . We then survey a large sample of the varied functional roles and structural contexts of cis nonPro , including the uses of specific amino acids for particular purposes . We emphasize aspects not previously covered : that cis nonPro essentially always ( except for vicinal disulfides ) occurs in well ordered structure , and especially the great concentration of occurrence in proteins that process or bind carbohydrates ( identified by occurrence on the CAZy website ) .
Prenyl chains come in multiple sizes , fulfilling unique and essential functions across all domains of life . Prenyl chains are synthesized by prenyltransferase proteins . Despite their structural similarity , prenyltransferases exhibit substantial functional diversity to create lipophilic products of varying lengths . Human cis prenyltransferase ( h cisPT ) is a tetrameric enzyme responsible for the synthesis of long prenyl chains , consisting of 20 prenyl unit products that are essential to specific posttranslational modifications such as N glycosylation upon downstream processing . These long products are hypothesized to transfer from h cisPT to the ER membrane , but the mechanism of this transfer is not known . We use molecular dynamics simulations to identify a consistent membrane binding pose for h cisPT . By quantifying protein membrane contacts , we identify the aromatic amino acid residues in the conserved catalytic domain as critical to membrane binding . Determining relative protein membrane binding free energies through free energy perturbation highlights the importance of these residues for membrane association , as mutations lower membrane affinity by as much as 27 kcal/mol . These results are validated using FRET to demonstrate decreased catalytic activity and membrane binding in response to mutation . Together , our results suggest a possible mechanism for prenyl substrate transfer , where key aromatic residues facilitate h cisPT binding to the ER membrane in an orientation that holds the substrate containing active site near the membrane surface . Molecular dynamics simulations of the mutant exhibiting lower FRET show greater orientational variability relative to wild type . This evidence for a specific orientation of h cisPT provides a structural basis for isoprenoid association to the membrane during synthesis and prior to its release .
beta 1 , 2 Glucans are natural glucose polymers produced by bacteria and play important physiological roles , including as symbiotic or pathogenic factors and in osmoregulation . Glycoside hydrolase ( GH ) families related to beta 1 , 2 glucan metabolism ( GH144 , GH162 , and GH189 ) have recently been created by identification of two beta 1 , 2 glucanases and a beta 1 , 2 glucanotransferase , respectively . In this study , we further found four phylogenetically new groups with unknown functions ( Groups 1 4 ) by sequence database analysis using enzymes from GH144 and GH162 as queries . Biochemical analysis of representative proteins in these groups revealed that the proteins in Groups 1 3 showed hydrolytic activity specific to beta 1 , 2 glucan , while no substrate was found for the Group 4 protein . The kinetic parameters of the enzymes of Groups 1 3 were similar to GH144 and GH162 beta 1 , 2 glucanases , indicating that these enzymes were beta 1 , 2 glucanases . Optical rotation analysis revealed that the beta 1 , 2 glucanases followed an anomer inverting mechanism . Structural analysis of the proteins in Groups 1 4 revealed that they possess ( alpha/alpha ) barrel folds similar to those of GH144 , GH162 , and GH189 enzymes . Comparison of spatial positions of predicted acidic catalytic residues suggested that Groups 1 3 and GH144 had the same reaction mechanism . Overall , phylogenetic , biochemical , and structural analyses revealed that Groups 1 3 are new GH families , GH192 , GH193 , and GH194 , respectively , and that the three families belong to clan GH S ( clan GH , classification based on structural similarity ) as GH144 and GH
The receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 interacts with ephrin ( Efn ) ligands to mediate bi directional signals that drive cellular sorting processes during tissue development . In the context of various cancers , EphA2 can also drive invasive metastatic disease and represents an important target for cancer therapeutics . Natural Efn ligands sterically seed intertwined EphA2 clusters capable of recruiting intracellular kinases to mediate trans phosphorylation . Synthetic proteins , such as antibodies ( Abs ) , can mimic Efn ligands to trigger EphA2 signaling , leading to receptor internalization and degradation , and enabling intracellular delivery of conjugated drugs . Furthermore , Abs are capable of recruiting EphA2 into clusters distinct from those seeded by Efn . We developed three synthetic Abs targeting distinct EphA2 domains and determined the paratope valency necessary for agonist or antagonist properties of each of the three epitopes . Structural modeling of monovalent Fabs in complex with EphA2 elucidated competitive and non competitive mechanisms of inhibition of EphA2 canonical signaling . Likewise , modeling of clusters induced by bivalent IgGs elucidated multiple signaling competent EphA2 clusters capable of triggering a continuum of signaling strengths and provided insights into the requirement for multimerization of EphA2 to trigger phosphorylation . Our study shows how different agonist clusters lead to distinct kinase recruitment efficiencies to modify phosphotyrosine signal strength , and provides a panel of anti EphA2 Abs as reagents for the development of therapeutics .
Prey attraction is an integral component of the carnivorous syndrome , yet its molecular adaptations have remained largely unexplored . Our study utilized tissue specific transcriptomic data from the South American marsh pitcher plant , Heliamphora tatei , to explore the molecular and developmental basis of prey attraction . Carnivorous plants often present specialized structures associated with prey attraction and in Heliamphora , that function is carried out by the nectar spoon , a colorful extension of the top of the pitcher that is densely covered in nectaries . Through comparisons of gene expression in the nectar spoon with the rest of the pitcher , we identified a suite of differentially expressed genes that likely contribute to prey attraction , including enzymes involved in volatile synthesis and sugar transporters . We found that one lineage of sugar transporters , the 14a clade of SWEETs ( Sugars Will Eventually Be Exported Transporters ) , is highly upregulated in the nectar spoon and has evolved more rapidly in Sarraceniaceae , consistent with specialization for nectar transport as part of prey attraction . Among the genes related to volatile production , we found several enzymes best known for their role in floral scent . These results suggest that , similar to prey digestion , ancient genes are repurposed for novel functions during the transition to carnivory and may facilitate the repeated convergent origins of carnivory across angiosperms .
Pectin methylesterase ( PME ) dynamically regulates the biomechanical properties of the cell wall , which is involved in plant development and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress . However , its regulation mechanism of plant tolerance to heavy metal toxicity is limited . Here , we functionally characterized a member of the PME family , OsPME14 in rice , which is required for Cu tolerance . The expression of OsPME14 was induced by Cu . Compared to WT , lost function of OsPME14 decreased the PME activity and carboxyl group content , and weakened the retention capacity of the cell wall to Cu , thereby enhancing the Cu absorption by roots and Cu accumulation in the protoplasts . This promoted the Cu translocation from roots to shoots , resulting in the Cu hypersensitivity phenotype and more Cu concentration in grains . Notably , mutation of OsPME14 caused the expression change of the receptor kinase gene and the downstream MAPK cascade pathway . Besides , a PME inhibitor OsPMEI6 was identified to interact with OsPME14 , and the spatiotemporal expression of OsPMEI6 was highly consistent with OsPME14 , OsPMEI6 may regulate OsPME14 mediated Cu tolerance in rice . These results provide a novel insight into OsPME14 OsPMEI6 module mediated mechanisms of heavy metal tolerance in rice .
Amino acids are organic compounds that serve as the building blocks of proteins and peptides . Additionally , they function as bioactive molecules that play important roles in metabolic regulation and signal transduction . The ability of cells to sense fluctuations in intracellular and extracellular amino acid levels is vital for effectively regulating protein synthesis and catabolism , maintaining homeostasis , adapting to diverse nutritional environments and influencing cell fate decision . In this review , the recent molecular insights into amino acids sensing are discussed , along with the different sensing mechanisms in distinct organisms .
Deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) has emerged as a powerful approach for evaluating the effects of mutations on binding or function . Here , we developed a DMS by phage display protocol to define the specificity determinants of short linear motifs ( SLiMs ) binding to peptide binding domains . We first designed a benchmarking DMS library to evaluate the performance of the approach on well known ligands for 11 different peptide binding domains , including the talin 1 PTB domain , the G3BP1 NTF2 domain , and the MDM2 SWIB domain . Comparison with a set of reference motifs from the eukaryotic linear motif ( ELM ) database confirmed that the DMS by phage display analysis correctly identifies known motif binding determinants and provides novel insights into specificity determinants , including defining a non canonical talin 1 PTB binding motif with a putative extended conformation . A second DMS library was designed , aiming to provide information on the binding determinants for 19 SLiM based interactions between human and SARS CoV 2 proteins . The analysis confirmed the affinity determining residues of viral peptides binding to host proteins and refined the consensus motifs in human peptides binding to five domains from SARS CoV 2 proteins , including the non structural protein ( NSP ) The DMS analysis further pinpointed mutations that increased the affinity of ligands for NSP3 and NSP An affinity improved cell permeable NSP9 binding peptide was found to exert stronger antiviral effects than the wild type peptide . Our study demonstrates that DMS by phage display can efficiently be multiplexed and applied to refine binding determinants and shows how the results can guide peptide engineering efforts .
Beauvericin ( BEA ) , a cyclic depsipeptide , is a mycotoxin of the enniatin family and the secondary metabolite of various toxigenic fungi . Multiple biological functions of BEA have been well investigated , such as anti cancer , anti inflammatory , anti microbial , and immune activating functions . In a recent study , we showed that BEA can target Toll like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) to induce dendritic cell ( DC ) activation . In an in silico screen , we identified Cathepsin B ( CTSB ) as a potential additional interaction partner for BEA , which has been verified recently in a study showing inhibition of human CTSB activity by BEA in cell free assays . The underlying molecular mechanism of BEA mediated CTSB inhibition remains unknown , as do the cellular entities where this inhibition takes place . In this study , we determine the effects of BEA on CTSB within granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GM CSF ) cultured bone marrow derived dendritic cells ( BMDCs ) and human leukemia monocytic cell line THP 1 induced immature dendritic cells ( iDCs ) . BEA significantly suppresses CTSB activity in both mouse BMDCs and human iDCs . NMR analyses indicate that BEA directly interacts with CTSB . Enzyme kinetics show that BEA can directly inhibit CTSB activity and acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor . Molecular docking analysis revealed a putative binding site for BEA in human CTSB . Collectively , our study is the first to describe the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activity of BEA against human CTSB , suggesting that CTSB may be a candidate target for tumor therapy .
Protein RNA phase separation is at the center of membraneless biomolecular condensates governing cell physiology and pathology . Using an archetypical viral protein RNA condensation model , we determined the sequence of events that starts with sub second formation of a protomer with two RNAs per protein dimer . Association of additional RNA molecules to weaker secondary binding sites in this protomer kickstarts crystallization like assembly of a molecular condensate . Primary nucleation is faster than the sum of secondary nucleation and growth , which is a multistep process . Protein RNA nuclei grow over hundreds of seconds into filaments and subsequently into nanoclusters with approximately 600 nm diameter . Cryoelectron microscopy reveals an internal structure formed by incoming layers of protein RNA filaments made of ribonucleoprotein oligomers , reminiscent of genome packing of a nucleocapsid . These nanoclusters progress to liquid condensate droplets that undergo further partial coalescence to yield typical hydrogel like protein RNA coacervates that may represent the scaffold of large viral factory condensates in infected cells . Our integrated experimental kinetic investigation exposes rate limiting steps and structures along a key biological multistep pathway present across life kingdoms .
Schistosomiasis , a neglected tropical disease infecting over 200 million people globally , has limited therapeutic options . The 20S proteasome is a validated drug target for many parasitic infections , including those caused by Plasmodium and Leishmania , and we have previously demonstrated antischistosomal activity with inhibitors targeting Schistosoma mansoni 20S proteasome ( Sm20S ) . Here , we developed optimized subunit specific substrates for Sm20S based on data generated by Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry ( MSP MS ) . These substrates exhibit 9 fold or more improved activity compared to traditional human constitutive 20S proteasome ( c20S ) substrates . The optimized substrates also eliminated the need for extensive Sm20S purification , as robust enzyme activity could be detected in parasite extracts following an ammonium sulfate precipitation step . Finally , we show that the substrate and inhibition profiles for the 20S proteasome from the three medically important schistosome species are similar . This suggests that Sm20S focused inhibitor development can be efficiently extrapolated to the other schistosome species , leading to significant time and resource savings .
Systemic metabolic dysregulation in sepsis critically impacts patient survival . To better understand its onset , untargeted serum metabolomics and lipidomics are analyzed from 152 presymptomatic patients undergoing major elective surgery , and identified key metabolites , including serine and aminoadipic acid , that differentiate postoperative uncomplicated infection from sepsis . Using single nucleus RNA sequencing data from an in vivo mouse model of sepsis , tissue independent down regulation and tissue specific differences of serine and energy related genes including key module roles for the mitochondria linked genes , Cox4i1 , Cox8a , and Ndufa4 are identified . Finally , serine dependent metabolic shifts , especially in the liver , are revealed by using C/C murine data with labeled serine , and link altered activity of the serine hydroxymethyltransferase ( SHMT ) cycle with perturbed purine metabolism during sepsis . This study demonstrates the close interrelationship between early metabolite changes and mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis , improves the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology , and highlights metabolic targets to prospectively treat presymptomatic , but at risk , patients .

Prion diseases ( PrDs ) are a unique and fatal class of neurodegenerative disorders caused by misfolded proteinaceous infectious particles , or prions . While the pathogenic form was first documented in humans nearly a century ago , the global monitoring of PrDs only gained momentum after the " Mad Cow " epizootic and its human counterpart of the 1980s and 1990s . Currently , 34 countries track human prion cases annually , with over 27 , 000 cases . However , true prevalence estimates suggest significantly higher numbers , millions , highlighting the urgency of addressing these enigmatic diseases . Prions are exceptionally resilient , resisting conventional sterilization methods and persisting in environmental reservoirs , such as soil and plants , raising concerns about environmental and cross species transmission , particularly with the growing prevalence of chronic wasting disease ( CWD ) in cervids . This review explores the history , pathogenesis , presence , public health implications , and novel innovations in studying and treatment of PrDs . Future priorities should include the development of faster , cost effective diagnostic tools and systemic therapies to neutralize prions in affected individuals and mitigate environmental risks . Understanding and addressing the challenges posed by prions is critical for global health security in the wake of CWD .
SARS CoV 2 , the virus responsible for the COVID 19 pandemic , has undergone continuous evolution , leading to the emergence of variants with altered transmissibility and immune evasion . For the non structural proteins ( Nsps ) of SARS CoV 2 , there are limited structural analyses of their naturally occurring mutations . Here , we identified four non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms ( nsSNPs ) in the Epsilon lineage of SARS CoV 2 within Nsp15 , an endoribonuclease critical for immune evasion . Of these Epsilon nsSNPs , E266Q is in the catalytic domain . This study investigates the effects of this on enzymatic activity , structural stability , and oligomeric assembly by serial crystallography . By solving the structure of the Nsp15 hexamer at room temperature of both Nsp15 E266Q and WT in the P2 space group to 3 A , we observed asymmetric motions within its trimer subunits , a feature not visible in previously reported higher symmetry space groups . These asymmetric motions resemble substrate induced conformational changes reported in RNA bound Nsp15 structures , suggesting functional relevance . Biochemical analyses further reveal that Nsp15 E266Q exhibited significantly higher enzymatic activity and thermal stability compared to the wild type protein . These findings highlight how mutations in Nsp15 contribute to viral replication and immune evasion , offering insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying SARS CoV 2 variant evolution and potential therapeutic strategies .
PURPOSE : The purpose of this study was to show that hyperpolarized ( HP ) carbon 13 ( C ) MRI with multiple co HP substrates can probe the time course of renal metabolic changes in diabetes . METHODS : [1 C]pyruvate and [1 , 3 C]acetoacetate were co HP for simultaneous metabolic assessment of cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments , respectively . A custom multi band spectral spatial radiofrequency pulse was designed for enhanced detection of downstream metabolites of both substrates . In vivo co HP C kidney spectra were acquired serially in rats with uncontrolled insulin deficient diabetes over a period of 8 weeks . Time courses of changes in apparent metabolic conversions of [1 C]pyruvate and [1 , 3 C]acetoacetate were evaluated and compared with routine clinical markers of kidney disease obtained by serum and urine sampling . RESULTS : Metabolic conversions of both co HP substrates showed large shifts in diabetic kidney with chronic hyperglycemia . Production of both HP [1 C]lactate and [1 , 3 C]beta hydroxybutyrate increased over time , with beta hydroxybutyrate signal significantly elevated at 4 weeks , sustained at 8 weeks . Lactate trended higher at 4 weeks , with a larger , significant increase at 8 weeks . Serum and urine markers of renal function were unaltered from baseline throughout the time course , without significant change in serum creatinine nor evidence of albuminuria . CONCLUSION : Noninvasive C MRI using multiple co HP metabolic substrates , whose activities are localized to distinct cellular compartments , could enable early detection of diabetic kidney damage .
PURPOSE : Pegvaliase is an enzyme substitution therapy for phenylketonuria , an autosomal recessive disorder of amino acid metabolism resulting in phenylalanine ( Phe ) accumulation , intellectual disability , and behavioral/psychiatric disorders . The phase 3 PRISM trials ( NCT01819727 , NCT01889862 , NCT03694353 ) established pegvaliase efficacy in reducing blood Phe , but its pharmacokinetics differs between individuals , resulting in varying times to achieve clinically meaningful blood Phe targets . METHODS : Using participant level data from PRISM , we developed a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model that explains individual level blood Phe patterns as a function of pegvaliase clearance during the maintenance phase . RESULTS : As pegvaliase exposure induces immune tolerization , drug clearance declines . A period of high sensitivity of blood Phe to dietary Phe intake and pegvaliase exposure is observed at approximately 120 200 mumol/L Phe , reflected in increased blood Phe volatility . This model suggests that this volatility represents impending , but incomplete , tolerization , and that reducing pegvaliase dose or liberalizing dietary Phe intake at or before this stage is premature and can result in marked blood Phe increases . With continued exposure , pegvaliase clearance continues to decline , and dietary Phe intake and blood Phe become uncoupled . CONCLUSION : These analyses establish how tolerization presents clinically and suggest a staged therapeutic approach : tolerance induction ; diet liberalization ; gradual dose adjustment .
Children with Trisomy 21 ( T21 ) have an increased incidence of pulmonary hypertension ( PHTN ) ; most commonly due to congenital heart/lung diseases but also in conjunction with other T21 associated gastrointestinal and metabolic abnormalities . This report describes a 2 days old , full term male neonate with T21 , without significant cardiac anomalies presenting with severe hypoxic respiratory failure eventually leading to death . Autopsy confirmed T21 associated dysmorphic features and revealed both extra and intrahepatic congenital portosystemic shunts ( CPSS ) . Additionally , the liver demonstrated dilated hepatic and portal veins and mildly altered lobular architecture without any focal lesions . Bilateral lungs showed mild alveolar maldevelopment , double capillary loops , and normal lung to body weight ratio without vascular hypertensive changes . This case underscores the importance of careful examination of the liver hilum and considering CPSS as a potential etiology of PHTN in neonates with T21 in the absence of cardiac defects or significant lung disease .

Introduction & ObjectiveLatent autoimmune diabetes mellitus ( LADA ) , a heterogeneous disease , is much more common in society than thought . Although it has been claimed that LADA is similar to type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) from a cardiovascular perspective , there is no clear consensus . In this context , the objective of this study is to assess subclinical dysfunction in the left and right ventricles in patients with LADA using novel tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI ) parameters . Materials &MethodsThe sample of this observational case control study consisted of 57 consecutive patients aged between 30 and 70 years who applied to the endocrinology and metabolism outpatient clinics , were diagnosed with LADA , and were referred to the cardiology clinic for echocardiographic ( ECHO ) evaluation . The control group consisted of 60 healthy volunteers . Participants ' demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were recorded . All participants underwent ECHO using conventional ECHO and TDI . Subclinical left ventricular dysfunction was assessed using the myocardial performance index ( MPI ) and isovolumic myocardial acceleration ( IVA ) . ResultsThere were no significant differences between the patient and control groups in terms of conventional ECHO parameters . The left ventricular ( LV ) MPI was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group ( 54 +/ 11 vs 47 +/ 07 , p = 008 ) . There was no significant difference between the groups in right ventricular ( RV ) MPI ( 49 +/ 10 vs 46 +/ 70 , p = 217 ) . IVA was decreased in both ventricles ( IVA mitral : 03 +/ 44 vs 78 +/ 66 , p = 008 and IVA tricuspid : 67 +/ 88 vs 42 +/ 97 , p = 034 ) . Both LV IVA and RV IVA were found to be significantly correlated with glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies ' ( GADA ) levels in the negative direction ( R = 290 , p = 005 and R = 340 , p = 001 ) . ConclusionsIt was observed that LADA negatively affected the systolic and diastolic functions of both ventricles , with its effect being more pronounced in the left ventricle . Glycemic control and autoantibody titers were found to be correlated with TDI parameters , emphasizing their relevance in assessing cardiac dysfunction . FAU Oksen , Dogac
BACKGROUND : Primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) in children is quite rare , with a prevalence of 2 5 cases per 100 , 000 children . Hypercalcemia in PHPT has a negative impact on the gastrointestinal tract , urinary , musculoskeletal and nervous systems . Timely diagnosis of the disease in children is difficult due to its rare occurrence and variety of clinical symptoms . AIM : To study clinical manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism in children depending on the degree of hypercalcemia . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Retrospective observational study with a prospective component 50 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism . All patients underwent a comprehensive laboratory and instrumental study at the Institute of Pediatric Endocrinology , Endocrinology Research Center of Russia in the period 2014 RESULTS : The clinical manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism in children are very diverse . Weakness and fatigue were observed in 36% of patients ( CI ( 23 ; 51 ) ) . Frequent manifestations of the gastrointestinal tract were nausea in 20% ( CI ( 10 ; 34 ) ) , gastritis in 38% , ( CI ( 25 ; 53 ) ) , duodenogastric reflux in 24% , CI ( 13 ; 38 ) . Hypercalciuria was detected in 64% of patients ( CI ( 49 ; 77 ) ) , urolithiasis in 36% ( CI ( 23 ; 51 ) . Complaints of leg pain were observed in 24% of patients ( CI ( 13 ; 38 ) ) deformity of the lower extremities was present in 20% ( CI ( 10 ; 34 ) ) . 16% of patients had a history of low traumatic fractures ( CI ( 7 ; 29 ) ) . The median age of onset of the first clinical symptoms of PHPT in children was 7 years [6 ; 2] . At the time of diagnosis of the disease , 12 patients ( 24% ) had no complaints and were examined due to incidentally detected hypercalcemia ( n=3 ) , hypercalciuria ( n=1 ) , and detected formations of the parathyroid gland according to ultrasound ( n=5 ) , with a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1 ( n=3 ) . To identify the relationship between the clinical manifestations of PHPT and blood calcium levels , all patients were divided into 3 groups depending on the level of hypercalcemia : mild hypercalcemia 29 patients , moderate 16 , severe According to the results of the study , a statistically significant relationship between the presence of individual clinical manifestations of PHPT and the degree of hypercalcemia was not identified , however , a statistical tendency was noted between the presence of individual symptoms of the disease ( hypercalciuria , weight loss , vomiting , pain in abdomen , constipation , esophagitis , rib pain , gait disturbance ) and blood calcium levels , and a positive association was found between hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia . In addition , it was noted that in patients with severe hypercalcemia , the number of clinical signs is significantly higher than in patients with mild or moderate hypercalcemia . CONCLUSION : The study demonstrates the variety of clinical manifestations of PHPT , for which doctors of various specialties pediatricians , gastroenterologists , nephrologists , neurologists , orthopedic traumatologists , can observe children . In the presence of symptoms and diseases such as fatigue , nausea , pain in the legs , deformation of the lower extremities , low traumatic fractures , urolithiasis , gastritis , it is necessary to examine the level of calcium in the blood in children .

Hepatogenic diabetes ( HepD ) is a form of diabetes where the primary pathogenesis is a liver disease , usually cirrhosis , complicated by the development of portal hypertension with the formation of porto caval shunts . In the development of HepD , in addition to traditional risk factors for carbohydrate metabolism disorders , the pathogenetic features of liver diseases play a significant role . However , the exact mechanism of HepD development remains unclear , and several questions are still open for discussion . Despite having distinct pathophysiological and clinical features , hepatogenic diabetes is currently not considered as an independent disease . This is likely due to the difficulties in differentiating between types of diabetes due to the bidirectional relationship between glucose metabolism disorders and chronic liver diseases . It is known that diabetes negatively affects the development and progression of chronic liver diseases of various etiologies , and their combination is associated with worse clinical outcomes in terms of mortality , the occurrence of liver decompensation , and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Unfortunately , early diagnosis and the selection of optimal therapeutic strategies for diabetes may be challenging due to the lack of established clinical guidelines and the presence of comorbidities in patients with HepD .

BACKGROUND : Usually , a hypoglycemic episode occurs due to inadequacy of the administered insulin dose in accordance with the current physiological situation . Activated systems aimed at increasing blood glucose levels serve as precursors of hypoglycemia and markers of the severity of hyperinsulinemia . Therefore , determining their components can serve as a more subtle and sensitive approach to assessing the physiological appropriateness of different insulin therapy options . AIM : To investigate the markers ( biochemical , clinical , and morphological ) and the degree of activation of the stress system preceding the development of hypoglycemic episodes in patients with type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) undergoing insulin therapy . MATERIALS AND METHODS : A cross sectional observational clinical study was conducted involving 74 patients with type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) . All patients underwent examination , which included assessment of the history of hypoglycemic episodes , quality of life using the SF 36 questionnaire , levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , insulin like growth factor 1 ( IGF 1 ) , cortisol , C reactive protein ( CRP ) , coagulation profile , and 24 hour urinary cortisol excretion . Evaluation of patients ' sleep characteristics was performed based on the results of completed questionnaires : Sleep Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale . Patients underwent overnight polysomnography ( PSG ) with interpretation according to the AASM 2012 standards . RESULTS : Patients with a higher frequency of hypoglycemic episodes showed a decrease in IGF 1 levels at all stages ( 140 [123 : 162] ; 98 [93 : 121] , p=005 ) , worse quality of life scores across all domains of the SF 36 questionnaire ( 95 [88 : 100] ; 84 [77 : 92] , p=001 ) . As the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes increased , polysomnography data revealed an increase in the number of awakenings lasting more than 3 minutes ( 2 [1 : 3] ; 3 [2 : 4] ; p=03 ) , increased time spent in bed ( 1 [95 : 4] ; 2 [6 : 551] ; p=03 ) , increased sleep duration ( 5 [05 : 468] ; 489 [5 : 519] , p=006 ) , and in creased total sleep time ( 5 [75 : 422] ; 439 [5 : 486] , p=008 ) . CONCLUSION : An increase in the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes should be accompanied by activation of the stress response system ; however , repeated episodes of hypoglycemia lead to depletion of the stress response system , as evidenced by a decrease in the level of IGF 1 in patients with frequent hypoglycemic episodes . Hypoglycemic episodes occurring not only during night time but also at other times disrupt the sleep structure by increasing the frequency of nocturnal awaken ings . FAU Karamullina , R A
Primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) is a common endocrine disorder characterized by autonomous secretion of parathyroid hormone by altered parathyroid glands . In most cases PHPT is a sporadic disease , 5 10% of observations are genetically determined syndromal and non syndromal forms . Studies of families with hereditary forms of PHPT have led to the discovery of key oncosuppressor genes and proto oncogenes whose somatic mutations underlie the development of many sporadic parathyroid tumors . Another interest in the pathogenesis of primary hyperparathyroidism is studying mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in tumor tissue . In the first part of this review , we will discuss the classification , morphology , and etiology of PHPT . In the second part , we will present a summary of the most important studies using genetic analysis , classified according to the method used . FAU Bagirova , H V
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) encompasses a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by defects in enzymes critical for steroidogenesis , with 21 hydroxylase deficiency due to mutations in the CYP21A2 gene being the most prevalent form . Since the introduction of replacement therapy and neonatal screening programs in the 1950s , there has been a significant increase in survival rates among newborns diagnosed with CAH . However , despite these advancements , mortality associated with this condition remains disproportionately high . Achieving optimal therapeutic compensation through medication remains a complex challenge , contributing to a range of long term complications . These complications stem from both the underlying disease and its treatment , impacting key physiological functions , including metabolism , growth and development , cardiovascular health , and fertility . These multifaceted outcomes underscore the need for ongoing research and the refinement of therapeutic approaches to better manage this intricate condition . This article presents a series of four clinical cases of CAH characterized by the absence of sustained compensation for glucoand mineralocorticoid deficiencies . These cases were further complicated by the development of large adrenal masses and ectopic testicular adrenal rest tissue ( TART ) , emphasizing the challenges in achieving long term disease management .

BACKGROUND : Autoimmune diseases such as Graves ' disease are complex pathologies that often require intensive and long term treatment . However , the mechanisms contributing to the development and maintenance of this pathology are still not fully understood . Understanding the role of the innate immune response , especially in the context of monocytes , in the development of Graves ' disease remains a poorly understood aspect . AIM : To study the level of ROS production in monocytes in patients with Graves ' disease after RAI to identify the level of activation of the macrophage monocyte system . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The hormonal status and monocyte activity were analyzed before and 1 , 3 and 6 months after RAI . The level of ROS was determined using spontaneous and luminol and luceginin derived chemiluminescence . RESULTS : The study included 48 patients with Graves ' disease , aged from 18 to 65 years . In patients with Graves ' disease , a decrease in the intensity of free radical processes in monocytes was detected compared to the control group . These changes were observed both before and after RAI . It has been shown that changes in ROS production are independent of thyroid function and antibody levels . The changes indicate the potential immunosuppressive effects of radionuclide treatment and its effect on monocyte NADPH oxidase activity . A decrease in the production of secondary ROS in monocytes was also noted , which may indicate a decrease in the activation of monocytes during antigenic stimulation and inhibition of autoimmune processes . CONCLUSION : Reduced metabolic activity of monocytes and low levels of ROS synthesis correlate with inhibition of the autoimmune process and decreased activation of the macrophage monocyte system . The study confirms the importance of the role of monocytes in the ROS production system and their influence on the autoimmune process in Graves ' disease . These results may have clinical significance and contribute to the development of new immunotropic strategies for the treatment of this disease . FAU Fomina , D V
Breast cancer , the most prevalent malignant tumour in women , is characterised by high metastatic potential and frequent recurrence , both of which significantly impact patient prognosis following metastasis . To address this challenge , identifying novel therapeutic target combinations is critical for improving metastatic breast cancer treatment . This study investigates the mechanism by which asparaginyl endopeptidase ( AEP ) regulates breast cancer metastasis . Bioinformatics analysis revealed a potential interaction between AEP and CD74 , which was subsequently confirmed through co immunoprecipitation ( co IP ) experiments . Further investigations demonstrated that AEP activates ERK pathway phosphorylation via CD74 regulation , thereby enhancing epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) progression and promoting breast cancer cell migration . Compared to controls , dual inhibition of AEP and CD74 effectively reduced EMT markers and the migratory capacity of cancer cells in vitro . Subsequent in vivo experiments showed that this combinatorial strategy significantly suppressed breast cancer lung metastasis in mice without observable toxicity . These findings elucidate the molecular mechanism through which AEP promotes metastasis via CD74 regulation , while validating the therapeutic efficacy and safety of dual AEP/CD74 targeting . This study provides a novel conceptual framework and potential therapeutic targets for metastatic breast cancer intervention .
The aetiology of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) is not clear , and may involve disorders in multiple systems . This study aims to perform the morphological and molecular analysis of neuromuscular junctions ( NMJs ) and explore the asymmetry of paraspinal muscles in AIS . We collected paraspinal muscles from AIS patients during surgery and also enrolled congenital scoliosis ( CS ) and non scoliosis patients as controls . We performed immunofluorescence staining of NMJs for morphological analysis . Then , we extracted NMJs regions for further validation at the molecular level . We also explored the neurogenic abnormalities in the convex side and compared the asymmetry of paraspinal muscles . Morphological analysis of NMJs showed that the nerve terminal related variables in the convex side were significantly decreased . The expression of denervation markers was increased in the synapse rich regions . The expression of denervation markers in the convex paraspinal muscles was also significantly increased . Compared with CS and non scoliosis patients , paraspinal muscles of AIS exhibited the transformation of fibre types , characterised by an increase in the proportion of type I fibres in the convex side . The phenomenon of fibre type grouping was also noted , confirming the presence of neurogenic abnormalities . This study first investigated the morphological and molecular disorders of NMJs in the paraspinal muscles from AIS patients . We found that the neurogenic abnormalities existed in the convex side of the paraspinal muscle , which could lead to the conversion and grouping of fibre types . This resulted in an imbalance of bilateral paraspinal muscles and might be a potential driver of scoliosis .
Kruppel like factor 15 ( KLF15 ) is a transcription factor contributing to the pathophysiology of multiple diseases , including metabolic syndromes . It is 416 residues long , with a C2H2 type zinc finger ( ZnF ) domain that binds to GC rich regions regulating transcription . The role of KLF15 in glucogenesis and glucose level maintenance is well established . However , the DNA interaction mechanism at the atomic level remains unresolved . Here , we utilised computational structural biology tools to address this knowledge gap . The KLF15 ZnF domain interacting with DNA was modelled with AlphaFold Alanine substitution of the KLF15 ZnF domain DNA complex revealed that residues K334A , R334A , Y332A and R392A significantly affect the binding affinities ( DeltaDeltaG ) to DNA . To understand the conformational stability and dynamics of the KLF15 ZnF domain complexes , 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed . Additionally , molecular mechanics generalised Born ( MM/GBSA ) surface area was utilised to calculate total binding energies . The binding energies of the wild type KLF15 ZnF domain ( 0 +/ 17 kcal/mol ) demonstrated a more robust binding affinity to DNA than K334A ( 4 +/ 35 kcal/mol ) , R344A ( 8 +/ 37 kcal/mol ) , Y332A ( 7 +/ 42 kcal/mol ) and R392A ( 8 +/ 30 kcal/mol ) . The findings highlighted the unstable dynamics of the alinine substituted resdiues that consequently reduce the binding free energy compared to the wild type KLF15 ZnF domain . In conclusion , the four identified residues are essential to recognise KLF15 ZnF DNA binding and can be considered potential hotspots for the therapeutics development for type 2 diabetes .
BACKGROUND AND AIM : Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease ( MASLD ) is the predominant cause of chronic liver disease , with dysregulation of bile acid ( BA ) metabolism and intestinal microbiota being intricately associated with MASLD progression . In this study , we investigated the role of ileal FXR in MASLD progression and BA metabolism in portal blood . METHODS : Sprague Dawley rats were fed a typical western diet for 20 weeks , followed by local perfusion of AAV2 shNr1h4 to downregulate Nr1h4 expression in ileum tissue . To investigate the effect of ileal FXR on BA reabsorption and gut microbiota , portal blood and cecal fecal samples were collected from MASLD rats injected with AAV2 Ctrl or AAV2 shNr1h4 for metabolomics targeting BAs and 16S rRNA sequencing analysis . RESULTS : Our results showed that hepatic steatosis and inflammation were alleviated , whereas the reabsorption of secondary BAs and unconjugated BAs into the portal blood was enhanced when ileal FXR was knocked down . Furthermore , knockdown of ileal FXR resulted in a significant alteration in composition of the cecal microbiota , characterized by an increasing abundance of microbes involved in secondary BA production , including Escherichia , Adlercreutzia , Eubacterium , and Clostridium . CONCLUSION : These findings suggest that downregulation of ileal FXR ameliorates the progression of MASLD in rats by modulating BA metabolism mediated by the gut microbiota , indicating that ileal FXR might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of MASLD .
INTRODUCTION : The purpose of this study is to examine associations between kidney disease and cognitive impairment among diverse middle aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals . METHODS : Between 2016 and 2018 , the Study of Latinos Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging ( SOL INCA ) enrolled diverse Hispanic/Latino individuals ages 50 years and older ( n = 6377 ) . Cognitive function , cognitive change , and mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) were the primary outcomes . Chronic kidney disease ( CKD , defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 mL/min per 73 m2 or urine albumin creatinine ratio [uACR] >/= 30 mg/g ) and two independent secondary exposures ( i . e . , eGFR and uACR ) were examined . RESULTS : CKD was associated with lower cognitive function and 7 year cognitive decline independent of diabetes and hypertension . CKD was associated with MCI , but the effect attenuated by adjustments for CVD risk factors . More albuminuria was associated with lower cognitive function , cognitive decline , independent of CVD risk factors . DISCUSSION : CKD and higher albuminuria were linked to lower cognitive function , cognitive decline , and elevated risk for MCI among diverse middle aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals . HIGHLIGHTS : Kidney disease has garnered increased attention in interpreting blood based biomarkers of Alzheimer ' s disease and related disorders . Hispanic/Latino individuals are at increased risk for kidney disease . We found that urinary albumin to creatinine ratio outperformed estimated glomerular filtration in relation to cognitive function and impairment . Our findings suggest that kidney dysfunction is an independent marker of cognitive function and impairment .
The prevalence and incidence of young onset type 2 diabetes is increasing globally , especially in low and middle income countries , and predominantly affects non White ethnic and racial populations . Young onset type 2 is heterogeneous in terms of the genetic and environmental contributions to its underlying pathophysiology , which poses challenges for glycemic management . Young at risk individuals remain underrepresented in clinical trials , including diabetes prevention studies , and there is still an insufficient evidence base to inform practice for this age group . Improvements in diabetes care delivery have not reached young people who will progress to have disabling complications at an age when they are most productive . This review summarizes recent studies on the epidemiology of young onset type 2 diabetes and its complications . We discuss the genetic and environmental risk factors that act in concert to promote glycemic dysregulation and early onset of type 2 diabetes . We provide perspectives on diabetes prevention and management , and propose strategies to address the unique medical and psychosocial issues associated with young onset type 2 diabetes . The Precision Medicine to Redefine Insulin Secretion and Monogenic Diabetes Randomized Controlled Trial ( PRISM RCT ) is the first large scale clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of a structured care model that integrates biogenetic markers with communication and information technology on attaining strict metabolic targets and improving clinical outcomes in individuals with young onset type 2 diabetes . The results of this study will inform the scientific community about the impact of multifactorial intervention and precision care in young patients , for whom the legacy effect is particularly significant .
This study characterized antibody dependent enhancement ( ADE ) in serum samples from individuals exposed to SARS CoV 2 via infection or vaccination and evaluated its association with SARS CoV 2 variants ( Wuhan and Omicron ) , MERS CoV , and NL ADE assays were performed on sera from SARS CoV 2 infected patients ( n = 210 ) with varying disease severity and vaccinated individuals ( n = 225 ) who received adenovirus vector , inactivated virus or mRNA vaccines . ADE was assessed using pseudoviruses ( PVs ) in BHK cells expressing FcgRIIa . Neutralizing antibody levels , total IgG , IgG subclasses , and complement activation were analyzed using ELISA and neutralization assays . ADE was observed in 2% of infection samples ( primarily severe cases ) and 3% of vaccinated samples ( adenovirus vector and inactivated virus groups ) . ADE positive samples showed reduced neutralizing activity , while total IgG and IgG subclasses did not differ significantly between ADE positive and negative samples . Complement activation was elevated in severe cases but did not correlate clearly with ADE . Notably , MERS CoV PV induced ADE in a subset of infected samples , but no ADE was detected for NL ADE was observed in SARS CoV 2 infected individuals , particularly in severe cases , and in those vaccinated with adenovirus vector and inactivated virus vaccines , but not with mRNA vaccines . Cross reactivity leading to ADE was detected for MERS CoV but not for NL ADE was associated with reduced neutralizing antibody activity and elevated complement activation in severe infections , though the specific role of complement in ADE remains unclear . These findings highlight the need to investigate the mechanisms underlying ADE and its implications for vaccine design and post infection immunity against respiratory viruses . FAU Thomas , Swapna
INTRODUCTION : This study investigated the role of the ubiquitin proteasome system ( UPS ) in dominantly inherited Alzheimer ' s disease ( DIAD ) by examining cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) levels of UPS proteins . METHOD : The SOMAscan assay was used to detect changes in UPS proteins in mutation carriers ( MCs ) relative to disease progression ; imaging and CSF biomarkers of amyloid , tau , and neurodegeneration measures ; and Clinical Dementia Rating scale . RESULTS : Subtle increases in specific ubiquitin enzymes were detected in MCs up to two decades before symptom onset , with more pronounced elevations in UPS activating enzymes near symptom onset . Significant correlations were found between UPS proteins and Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) biomarkers , especially between autophagy markers and late stage tau biomarkers , microglia , and axonal degeneration . DISCUSSION : The rise in UPS proteins alongside tau related markers suggests UPS involvement in tau neurofibrillary tangles . Elevated CSF UPS proteins in DIAD MCs may serve as indicators of disease progression , and may support the UPS as a therapeutic target in AD . HIGHLIGHTS : This study investigates the ubiquitin proteasome system ( UPS ) in Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer ' s Disease ( DIAD ) , highlighting early molecular changes linked to disease progression . Using SOMAscan proteomics , we identified significant UPS protein alterations in cerebrospinal fluid of mutation carriers , notably up to 20 years before clinical symptom onset . Correlations between UPS protein levels and Alzheimer ' s biomarkers , particularly tau and neurodegeneration markers , suggest a strong association between UPS dysregulation and tau pathology in DIAD . Dynamic UPS changes align with A/T biological staging : UPS proteins were shown to increase across Abeta/tau ( A/T ) groups , with largest increases in the A+/T+ group , reinforcing their role in late stage tau pathology and disease progression . These findings underscore the potential of UPS proteins as early biomarkers for Alzheimer ' s disease progression and as novel therapeutic targets , especially in tau pathology driven neurodegeneration . This work contributes to understanding AD pathogenesis , by emphasizing the importance of protein quality control systems and by offering avenues for future biomarker discovery and therapeutic development in Alzheimer ' s disease .
Candida albicans is a primary pathogen implicated in invasive fungal infections . Through its intricate iron uptake and regulatory systems , C . albicans adeptly adapts to various iron rich environments , circumventing the growth and virulence restrictions imposed by the host ' s nutritional immunity and intensifying infection severity . This fungus activates the Sef1 Sfu1 Hap43 iron homeostasis regulatory circuit via iron bioavailability sensors ( iron sulfur cluster assembly system ) . This activation precisely regulates multiple iron uptake pathways , including the high affinity iron reduction system , heme iron uptake pathway , and siderophore uptake system , as well as genes involved in iron utilization and storage , thus ensuring effective iron acquisition and maintaining iron homeostasis across diverse environmental conditions and developmental stages . Conversely , disruptions in iron metabolism markedly diminish C . albicans ' s pathogenic potential by impairing mitochondrial function , suppressing hyphal formation , limiting fungal colonization , and reversing antifungal drug resistance . This review presents a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms governing iron uptake and regulation in C . albicans and examines the consequences of impaired iron homeostasis on mitochondrial function , hyphal formation , infection progression , and drug resistance . Our goal is to provide a theoretical framework to better understand the pathogenesis of C . albicans and to support the development of targeted therapeutic strategies against this resilient pathogen .

Pediatric sepsis is a prevalent severe condition with a high disability rate and mortality . The purpose of this study was to investigate how NK cell related genes ( NKGs ) function in the diagnosis of pediatric sepsis . Differential analysis and Venn analysis were utilized to screen differentially expressed NKGs ( DE NKGs ) in pediatric sepsis . The PPI network of DE NKGs was generated using STRING . Candidate drugs are predicted using the CMAP database . miRNA and transcription factor ( TF ) targeting hub genes were screened using the Networkanalyst website . A total of 22 DE NKGs were identified , which were mainly enriched in immune related biological processes . Ten hub genes that were filtered out from DE NKGs exhibited good diagnostic performance . Immune infiltration analysis revealed that macrophages and neutrophils had higher infiltration abundance in the pediatric sepsis group , whereas NK cells had higher infiltration abundance in the normal group . NKGs ( LCK , FCER1G , PRF1 , CD247 , GZMB , CD2 , CCL4 , KLRD1 , CCL5 , and ITGB2 ) with diagnostic performance were successfully predicted , and some potential miRNAs , TFs , and candidate drugs were also predicted . In conclusion , this study threw light on a comprehensive understanding of the role of NK cells in pediatric sepsis .
Komagataella phaffii , also known as Pichia pastoris , is a powerful host for recombinant protein production , in part due to its exceptionally strong and tightly controlled P ( AOX1 ) promoter . Most K . phaffii bioprocesses for recombinant protein production rely on P ( AOX1 ) to achieve dynamic control in two phase processes . Cells are first grown under conditions that repress P ( AOX1 ) ( growth phase ) , followed by methanol induced recombinant protein expression ( production phase ) . In this study , we propose a methanol free approach for dynamic metabolic control in K . phaffii using optogenetics , which can help enhance input tunability and flexibility in process optimization and control . The light responsive transcription factor EL222 from Erythrobacter litoralis is used to regulate protein production from the P ( C120 ) promoter in K . phaffii with blue light . We used two system designs to explore the advantages and disadvantages of coupling or decoupling EL222 integration with that of the gene of interest . We investigate the relationship between EL222 gene copy number and light dosage to improve production efficiency for intracellular and secreted proteins . Experiments in lab scale bioreactors demonstrate the feasibility of the outlined optogenetic systems as potential alternatives to conventional methanol inducible bioprocesses using K . phaffii .
Chloride ions ( Cl ( ) ) play a unique role in enhancing crop fruit quality , particularly through their effects on carbohydrate metabolism , although the underlying mechanism remains unclear . We optimized the Cl ( ) concentrations in tomato cultivation nutrient solutions via supplementation at varying levels and utilized an integrative approach combining biochemical assays , transcriptomics , and metabonomics to investigate how Cl ( ) modulates sugar metabolism in tomato fruits . Treatment with 3 5 mm Cl ( ) significantly improved plant biomass , photosynthesis , dry matter accumulation , and fruit quality without affecting yield or altering the dry matter distribution . Our findings indicate that Cl ( ) increased starch and sucrose contents in fruits during the cell enlargement stage and elevated glucose , fructose , chloride ions , potassium ions , magnesium ions , and manganese ions during the red ripening stage . Physiological and correlation analyses revealed that Cl ( ) significantly enhanced the activity of alpha amylase , sucrose phosphate synthase , and sucrose synthase . Additionally , principal component analysis confirmed that the red ripening stage is a critical phase for the chloride regulation of fruit quality . Transcriptomic and targeted metabonomic analyses of mature fruits revealed that Cl ( ) predominantly affected gene expression related to starch and sucrose metabolism and ATP binding cassette ( ABC ) transporters , and specifically impacted ethylene synthesis . This study provides the first insight into the mechanism by which chloride affects carbohydrate metabolism and ethylene production in tomato fruits , and offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the functional roles of chloride in the interaction between these metabolic pathways .
The role of Anillin ( ANLN ) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) is not well understood . This study aimed to investigate the possible function and mechanism of ANLN in ccRCC . By using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) , we assessed ANLN expression in various cancers . Furthermore , the GEPIA database was used to analyze survival rates , pathway enrichment , and immune infiltration . Experiments were employed to study how ANLN expression affects tumor cell apoptosis , migration , invasion , and proliferation . Protein blotting was conducted to evaluate apoptosis , proliferation , epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , and the expression of proteins linked to the PI3K/AKT and P53 signaling pathways . mRNA levels of ANLN were notably increased in diverse cancer tissues , as shown in the TCGA database , a finding that was also observed in ccRCC patients . Remarkably , high ANLN levels were associated with lower pathologic grades and a worse survival prognosis in ccRCC patients . In vitro experiments revealed that knockdown of ANLN in ccRCC cells led to reduced proliferation , migration , invasion , and EMT . Additionally , ANLN seemed to impact immune evasion and increase the likelihood of distant metastasis based on immune infiltration analyses . The use of PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors or P53 signaling pathway agonists was effective in reducing the invasive behavior of ccRCC and correcting immunosuppression . Overall , ANLN could be a valuable prognostic indicator for the survival of ccRCC patients .
BACKGROUND : As an essential transcription factor , Myc associated zinc finger protein ( MAZ ) is frequently upregulated in many human tumors and is a well documented oncogene . However , we found high expression of MAZ was closely associated with good survival outcomes in patients with stomach adenocarcinoma ( STAD ) , and the underlying mechanism involved remains to be elucidated . We hypothesize that alternative splicing of MAZ plays an important role . METHODS : Pan cancer analysis of MAZ expression and prognostic significance was performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) data , with emphasis on its divergent prognostic impact in gastric cancer ( GC ) . MAZ protein levels were further validated in 356 GC tissue samples via immunohistochemistry . Functional investigations encompassed MAZ knockout ( KO ) and isoform specific rescue experiments to assess GC cell migration , alongside quantification of MAZ alternative splicing rates ( PSI ) . Additionally , RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing ( RIP seq ) identified PUF60 mediated regulation of MAZ isoforms . RESULTS : MAZ was upregulated in GC but served as an independent protective prognostic factor . MAZ KO enhanced GC cell migration , while isoform specific re expression revealed divergent roles : MAZ 2 promoted migration , whereas MAZ 1 and MAZ 3 suppressed it . Notably , MAZ 2 is highly expressed in GC and is associated with poor survival prognosis of patients . Lower PSI values of MAZ 2 were detected in GC . MAZ transcripts were directly bound by PUF PUF60 knockdown caused MAZ splice isoform switch , thereby enhancing GC cell migration . CONCLUSION : The prognostic difference of MAZ in GC stems from isoform specific functional antagonism , with cell migration phenotypes governed by the MAZ 1/3 versus MAZ 2 ratio . Targeting MAZ alternative splicing , particularly via PUF60 modulation , represents a novel therapeutic strategy .
BACKGROUND : Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) leads to persistent inflammation , contributing to chronic neuropathic pain . However , current treatments show limited efficacy . Three types of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) play different roles in inflammation and neuronal hyperexcitation . Therefore , this study aimed to determine the predominant NOS subtype involved in neuropathic pain after spinal contusion . METHODS : We investigated the effects of intrathecal NOS inhibitors on mechanical sensitivity following a moderate spinal contusion injury in male Sprague Dawley rats . These NOS inhibitors were N ( G ) nitro L arginine methyl ester hydrochloride ( L NAME ; non selective NOS inhibitor ) , 1400W ( iNOS inhibitor ) , Nomega propyl L arginine hydrochloride ( NPLA ; nNOS inhibitor ) and N5 ( 1 iminoethyl ) L ornithine ( L NIO ; eNOS inhibitor ) . Additionally , we analysed protein expression and cellular localisation of spinal NOS subtypes in rats that underwent SCI or sham procedures . RESULTS : Treatment with L NAME significantly reduced paw withdrawal threshold in a dose dependent manner , although motor deficits appeared at the highest dose ( 30 muM ) , while 1400W effectively alleviated mechanical hypersensitivity without motor side effects . NPLA showed limited efficacy , and L NIO had no effect . Protein expression of iNOS increased two fold in the L4 5 spinal segment of SCI rats compared with sham controls . After SCI , iNOS immunoreactivity colocalized with GFAP in the superficial laminae of the L4 5 spinal segment . Treatment with 1400W reduced the hyper reactivity of both iNOS and GFAP . CONCLUSIONS : These findings indicate that iNOS plays a significant role in below level neuropathic pain following thoracic spinal cord contusion in rats . Specific blockade of iNOS activity may have potential as a therapeutic intervention for spinal contusion induced neuropathic pain with reduced risk of side effects . SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT : iNOS inhibition effectively alleviated pain without motor side effects , unlike non selective NOS , nNOS and eNOS inhibitors . The colocalization of iNOS with astrocytes in the spinal cord suggests a key mechanism in pain maintenance . These findings highlight the potential of targeting iNOS as a therapeutic strategy for SCI induced neuropathic pain with reduced risks of side effects .
We previously reported a high level of seroconversion 1 year after COVID 19 vaccination in heart transplant recipients when vaccination was performed several years after transplantation . The aim of this study was to measure the seroconversion rate late after vaccination , in the absence of a new vaccine injection . We included 37 patients vaccinated in We measured immunoglobulin response using TrimericS Diasorin assay at the last visit between October 2024 and February We found a seroconversion rate of 95% , 2 +/ 13 years after last COVID 19 vaccination in the absence of new vaccine injection . Most of these patients ( 73% ) had a proven COVID 19 infection since vaccination . Interestingly , none of these patients had a severe form of COVID Thus , vaccination , followed by minor COVID 19 infections , effectively prevented severe forms .
The COVID 19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS CoV 2 ) has had a devastating impact worldwide . Currently , several vaccines are approved for emergency use in humans , and these vaccines have played a large role in controlling COVID Pregnant women and newborns constitute a special population for vaccine policy . Here , we established a maternal vaccination model by injecting pregnant mice with a SARS CoV 2 receptor binding domain ( RBD ) homodimer . Maternal immunization with the RBD dimer did not cause obvious adverse effects on pregnancy or fetal development . Moreover , two shot immunization fully protected dams and fetuses from SARS CoV 2 infection during pregnancy . Neutralizing antibodies can be transferred from immunized dams to pups , providing protection for both lactating and weaned pups against SARS CoV 2 infection . Our results indicate that , in addition to being used to vaccinate nonpregnant individuals , the RBD dimer can also be considered for maternal vaccination .
Despite significant therapeutic advances , cumulative DOX induced cardiotoxicity ( DIC ) events remain unacceptably high . Recent evidence has underscored the critical role of impaired glycolytic metabolism in cardiovascular damage . Neuraminidase 1 ( NEU1 ) , a member of the neuraminidase family , catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acids from glycoconjugates . Here , it is aimed to characterize the role of NEU1 on defective glycolysis during DIC . Mouse models with cardiac specific genetic modifications of Neu1 , Nrf2 , and Sirt1 underwent functional analyses , and RNA sequencing to clarify NEU1 ' s role in glycolytic metabolism during DIC . It is discovered that NEU1 is highly expressed after DOX exposure and positively correlated with defective glycolysis phenotypes . Cardiomyocyte specific deficiency of Neu1 ameliorated impaired glycolytic metabolism and DIC , whereas overexpression of Neu1 in cardiomyocytes exacerbated these pathological phenotypes . Mechanistically , the upregulation of Neu1 is attributed to HIF1alpha ' s transcriptional repression , which necessitated the collaboration of NRF Additionally , the C terminal region of NEU1 physically interacted with SIRT1 , facilitating its lysosomal mediated degradation and contributing to the aberrant glycolytic phenotype . The pharmacological or genetic manipulation of NRF2 and HIF1alpha remarkably abolished DOX induced NEU1 upregulation , compromised glucose metabolism , and DIC progression . Collectively , NEU1 as a key regulator of cardiac glycolysis is established , offering new therapeutic avenues for DIC through maintaining metabolic flexibility .
BACKGROUND : Liver machine perfusion ( MP ) has emerged as a promising organ preservation modality . Recent studies have shown that the addition of the kidneys to the circuit improves the biochemical environment and could benefit liver preservation . The aim of this study was to explore the technical and anatomical feasibility of en bloc liver pancreas kidney MP . We also examined the safety of ex vivo perfusion with a nonoxygen carrier solution and its effects on acid base and metabolic parameters using this novel multivisceral perfusion platform . METHODS : Five multivisceral allografts , including liver , pancreas , duodenum , and kidney , were perfused for 4 h with acellular perfusate . Hemodynamic and laboratory data were evaluated throughout the experiment . RESULTS : No system failure was reported . There were minimal changes in the acid base parameters during the experiment . Lactate and glucose levels were stable throughout hypothermic perfusion . There was a mild increase in liver function parameters in the last hour of hypothermic perfusion . No changes in creatinine levels were observed throughout the study . The urine output increased steadily during the experiment , with an average of 6 mL/h . CONCLUSION : We described an innovative multivisceral MP technique that could be further used as a platform for physiological studies and targeted therapeutic interventions . Further investigations are necessary to evaluate this ex vivo perfusion technique and provide insights into the feasibility of hypothermic acellular multivisceral MP in clinical scenarios .

Actin , a ubiquitous protein essential for numerous cellular functions , is found in all eukaryotes . Despite extensive research across molecular to organismal scales , fundamental questions persist regarding the regulation of dynamic actin architectures , their interaction with membranes , and their mechanical properties . Characterizing the factors governing these processes presents significant challenges . This review emphasizes the value of simplified , reconstituted systems in addressing these unresolved questions . We particularly highlight the critical importance of macroscopic , network level reconstitutions for tackling these issues . We first describe the available methodological toolkit for controlling actin polymerization spatiotemporally and confining actin networks within closed environments to examine boundary constraint effects or the impact of limited component availability on network properties . We then review studies employing these reconstituted systems to investigate how actin architecture influences various processes and how dynamic actin structures are established and maintained . Further , we discuss how network level reconstitutions have enhanced our understanding of actin networks ' mechanical properties and their interaction with the lipid membranes . Throughout the review , we discuss future perspectives for each topic and explain how macroscale reconstitutions can provide deeper mechanistic insights into actin related processes .
The purpose of this study was to explore between limb differences in gluteal , quadriceps , hamstring , and triceps surae muscle size and activity during a repeated vertical jump landing task in individuals with a history of unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACLR ) . Twelve recreationally active participants with a unilateral history of ACLR involving a semitendinosus autograft ( 1 5 years post surgery ) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) before and immediately after 60 vertical jumps . Exercise induced increases in transverse ( T2 ) relaxation times and resting muscle volumes were measured in 12 lower limb muscles . Linear mixed models were used to explore differences between the ACLR and uninjured contralateral limb , as well as their relationship with vertical jump performance . Reconstructed limbs displayed smaller muscle volumes in vastus medialis ( p = 028 ) , rectus femoris ( p = 019 ) , semitendinosus ( p < 001 ) , and gastrocnemius lateral head ( p = 028 ) than homonymous muscles in the uninjured contralateral limb . Limbs with a history of ACLR also exhibited smaller percentage changes in T2 relaxation time for semitendinosus ( p < 001 ) , semimembranosus ( p = 002 ) , lateral gastrocnemius ( p = 014 ) , and soleus ( p = 008 ) , while the vastus lateralis displayed a greater increase ( p = 001 ) than uninjured contralateral limbs . Between limb asymmetry in quadriceps muscle volume and activity was associated with between limb asymmetry in vertical jump landing impulse ( r = 30 34 ) . The findings from this study may help to inform the design of exercise interventions aimed at restoring lower limb function and reducing reinjury risk in individuals with a history of ACLR .
Muscle specific tyrosine kinase antibody positive myasthenia gravis ( MuSKMG ) is a rare subtype of MG that is often more refractory to immune treatment than acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) antibody positive MG . Therefore , novel therapeutic strategies are needed . We previously developed AChR Fc , an Fc fusion protein that neutralises pathogenic autoantibodies and suppresses pathogenic B cells while preserving normal immunity , as a potential treatment for AChR antibody positive MG . Subsequently , we conducted preliminary experiments on MuSK Fc , a fusion protein targeting MuSKMG , using patient serum samples . This study examined whether MuSK Fc binds to MuSK antibodies and inhibits MuSK antibody binding to MuSK . We found that MuSK Fc specifically binds to MuSK antibodies and prevents their interaction with MuSK . These findings indicate that MuSK Fc may neutralise pathogenic antibodies and suppress disease activity in MuSKMG .
BACKGROUND : Patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) are at increased cardiovascular risk . Since neutrophils play a central role in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease , this study analyzed neutrophil function in CKD patients . METHODS : A systematic review of neutrophil function in CKD patients compared to controls was performed according to PRISMA guidelines by searching PubMed and the Web of Science . A meta analysis summarized the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in CKD patients on dialysis in Forest plots . Influencer outlier analyses evaluated risk of bias . RESULTS : Overall , 92 studies were included , of which 18 in the meta analysis . Although study heterogeneity was high , the systematic review identified primarily reduced phagocytosis capacity but increased neutrophil degranulation and basal ROS production in neutrophils from CKD patients on hemodialysis compared to controls . Phagocytosis and basal ROS production were mainly unaltered in non dialysis dependent CKD patients and CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis . The meta analysis confirmed increased ROS generation in basal conditions predominantly in CKD patients on hemodialysis ( Hedges g = 20 , 95% CI : [32 ; 09] ) , with an insufficient study number for a clear comparison to CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis . However , upon neutrophil stimulation with sterile inflammatory triggers , ROS production was also increased in neutrophils from patients on peritoneal dialysis ( Hedges g = 89 , 95% CI : [34 ; 43] ) . CONCLUSION : Increased degranulation and basal ROS formation were observed in neutrophils of CKD patients on hemodialysis , which could contribute to their increased cardiovascular risk . Future studies should compare neutrophil activity in patients of different CKD stages and comorbidities also in relation to cardiovascular outcomes .
BACKGROUND & AIMS : Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease ( MASLD ) is a growing health challenge , particularly in Middle East and North Africa ( MENA ) countries . This study aimed to establish a consensus driven research and action agenda to address MASLD within the MENA region . METHODS : Following a global MASLD research and action agenda setting study , over two Delphi rounds ( Rs ) , MENA region experts ( R1 n = 112 , R2 n = 104 ) indicated their level of agreement with and provided feedback on MASLD research and action priorities via Qualtrics XM . In R2 , panellists also ranked the priorities , which were categorised across six domains : the human and economic burden , defining and implementing care models , disease management , education and awareness , patient and community perspectives , and leadership and policies for the MASLD public health agenda . RESULTS : The consensus built MASLD research and action priority agenda for the MENA region comprises 52 priorities . Combined agreement ( i . e . , ' agree ' + ' somewhat agree ' ) increased from 6% and 1% in R1 to 2% and 5% in R2 with the research ( n = 30 ) and action ( n = 22 ) priorities , respectively . The highest ranked research priorities included developing regional MASLD databases and validating non invasive diagnostic tools . The highest ranked action priorities included taking steps to enhance the adoption of lifestyle interventions among people living with MASLD and improving disease knowledge among healthcare providers . CONCLUSIONS : This region specific agenda can help to guide research and optimise clinical practice , thereby improving the understanding , prevention , and management of MASLD , enhancing health outcomes and reducing its burden within the MENA region .
Beige adipocytes in white adipose tissue ( WAT ) shares similar functions as brown adipocytes by converting lipids into heat through thermogenesis , while lipolysis is considered as a prerequisite for the activation of non shivering thermogenesis . beta3 adrenergic receptor ( beta3 AR ) agonist CL316 , 243 ( CL ) and cold exposure are known to enhance lipolysis and beiging of WAT in a PKA dependent manner , while the role of PKA independent pathways involved are still poorly understood . Here , we show that the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 1 ( Epac1 ) , a downstream target of cAMP , mediates beta3 AR activation to modulate thermogenesis and lipolysis in a PKA independent manner . Upon CL treatment or cold exposure , both thermogenic and lipolytic responses were compromised in Epac1 deficient mice , as evidenced by reduced oxygen consumption , less beige adipocytes , lower body temperature , and decreased circulating glycerol . Additionally , in vitro beige adipogenesis with or without cAMP analog treatment was significantly impaired in Epac1 deficient mice . Mechanistically , reduced total and phosphorylated p38gamma and decreased induction of nuclear factor activated in T cells 5 ( NFAT5 ) were observed in Epac1 deficient mice , which may contribute to the defective beiging of WAT . However , WAT of wild type and Epac1 deficient mice showed no significant induction difference in phosphorylation of HSL at PKA and AMPK sites with PKA activator , and in vitro beige adipogenesis was not altered in Epac1 deficient mice in response to PKA activation , indicating that Epac1 mediates lipolysis and beige adipogenesis in a PKA independent manner . Taken together , Epac1 mediates beta3 AR induced beiging and lipolysis of WAT via p38gamma NFAT5 axis in a PKA independent manner .
Perceptual illusions of having extra body parts offer an experimental method to investigate the limits of embodiment . It is well established that the embodiment of an artificial hand as one ' s own is dependent on spatial congruency . That is , the seen hand needs to be in a posture congruent with the actual hand . In this study , we aimed to investigate how constrained is the representation of a supernumerary body part by systematically varying the perceived rotation of an illusory sixth finger . Surprisingly , participants felt a sixth finger on their hand consistently for all induced orientations of finger extension and abduction ( 0 degrees , 90 degrees , 135 degrees , 180 degrees ) . The illusion showed no apparent decrease with increased induced rotation of the extra finger . We also measured the perceived orientation of the sixth finger , and our results show that participants felt an extended and an abducted sixth finger increasingly more rotated as the induced rotation also increased , while feeling their actual little finger in a normal position . Our results indicate that one can feel a supernumerary finger in an incongruent spatial location from one ' s actual fingers and hand , to an extent of 180 degrees of extension ( finger up ) and 180 degrees of abduction ( finger to the side ) . We therefore propose that the representation of the supernumerary finger has a strong independence from the actual finger and hand frame reference . FAU Cadete , Denise
The unknown pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) make treatment challenging . Neuroimaging genetics offers a method for identifying disease biomarkers for early diagnosis , but traditional approaches struggle with complex non linear , multimodal and multi expression data . However , traditional association analysis methods face challenges in handling nonlinear , multimodal and multi expression data . Therefore , a multimodal attention fusion deep self restructuring presentation ( MAFDSRP ) model is proposed to solve the above problem . First , multimodal brain imaging data are processed through a novel histogram matching multiple attention mechanisms to dynamically adjust the weight of each input brain image data . Simultaneous , the genetic data are preprocessed to remove low quality samples . Subsequently , the genetic data and fused neuroimaging data are separately input into the self reconstruction network to learn the nonlinear relationships and perform subspace clustering at the top layer of the network . Finally , the learned genetic data and fused neuroimaging data are analysed through expression association analysis to identify AD related biomarkers . The identified biomarkers underwent systematic multi level analysis , revealing biomarker roles at molecular , tissue and functional levels , highlighting processes like inflammation , lipid metabolism , memory and emotional processing linked to AD . The experimental results show that MAFDSRP achieved 58 in association analysis , demonstrating its great potential in accurately identifying AD related biomarkers . FAU Huang , Shan
BACKGROUND Osteoporotic fractures are a significant public health problem , yet traditional risk assessment methods have limitations . This retrospective study used the integrated Healthcare information ( iHi ) Data Platform of China Medical University Hospital ( CMUH ) ( 2000 2020 ) to evaluate associations between body mass index ( BMI ) , bone mineral density ( BMD ) , body fat percentage ( BFP ) , basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) , and site specific fracture risk in 9583 Taiwanese individuals . MATERIAL AND METHODS We extracted DXA measured BMD , BMI , BFP , and BMR data from CMUH ' s iHi Platform . Fracture events were identified using ICD 9/10 codes and verified through radiology reports . Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated fracture risk , adjusting for demographic and clinical factors . Mediation analysis quantified the contributions of BFP and BMR to the BMI fracture relationship . RESULTS During median follow up of 7 years , 1672 fractures ( 4% ) occurred . Individuals with normal BMD showed an 82% lower fracture risk compared to those with osteoporosis ( adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=18 , 95% CI : 15 22 , p<001 ) . Normal BFP significantly reduced fracture risk by 77% versus low BFP ( aHR=23 , 95% CI : 07 72 , p=012 ) . Higher BMR was consistently protective , with aHR=54 ( 95% CI : 36 82 , p=004 ) for BMR >/=1500 versus BMR< While underweight increased fracture risk ( aHR=75 , 95% CI : 29 36 , p<001 ) , obesity conferred no significant protection ( aHR=04 , 95% CI : 89 21 , p=58 ) . CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that fracture risk assessment should incorporate BFP and BMR alongside BMD and BMI . The " BMI paradox " was explained through mediation analysis , revealing BFP and BMR as critical intermediaries accounting for 50% and 32% of the BMI fracture relationship , respectively . These findings support developing ethnicity specific fracture risk models integrating body composition metrics for more precise risk stratification . FAU Lin , Yu Hsiang
INTRODUCTION : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia , whose incidence and prevalence have increased over the last 20 years and will continue to increase over the next 30 years . It is characterized by irregular atrial activation , leading to complications as stroke and heart failure . Due to its intermittent and asymptomatic nature , diagnosing and monitoring AF is challenging but crucial for effective treatment and prevention of serious complications . AREAS COVERED : This study reviews noninvasive medical devices available for home detection of AF by analyzing cardiac activity through ECG or photoplethysmography ( PPG ) . The review covers the technologies underlying single lead ECG acquisition and PPG sensors , and describes how these are used , also in combination , in home use medical devices ( including smartwatches and wristbands ) . EXPERT OPINION : Single lead ECG and PPG technologies in consumer electronics have revolutionized AF detection , making it more accessible and convenient for patients . Despite some limitations in signal quality and diagnostic scope , these devices offer significant benefits for early AF detection and management . The use of wearable devices , including smartwatches and wristbands , for heart activity monitoring represents a promising advancement in patient lead healthcare , potentially leading to better outcomes through timely medical intervention and improved patient engagement in managing their condition .

The fate of memories depends mainly on external and internal factors affecting cellular and systems consolidation on the one hand and the decay or weakening of the memory trace on the other hand . Over the past 40 years , research has focused on the mechanisms of memory consolidation , retrieval , and its consequences : extinction and reconsolidation . In contrast , much less is known about the molecular mechanisms required for the maintenance of memory storage and forgetting . These opposing forces are both activity and time dependent . Here , we summarize the molecular signatures and inherent mechanisms involved in memory persistence and active forgetting , highlighting recent findings on the role of dopamine neurotransmission , intracellular signaling cascades , and actin cytoskeleton dynamics in these processes .
AIMS : Prednisone is a widely used glucocorticoid in the treatment of lupus , although its dosing is often determined empirically . Prednisolone , the active metabolite of prednisone , is found in its free form in the serum . The goal of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) to forecast free prednisolone concentrations and its association with disease activity . METHODS : A total of 66 active SLE patients ( adults and children ) were included , and followed up prospectively ( 242 observations available ) . Plasma prednisolone concentrations were assessed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry , and the data were analysed using Monolix software . The pharmacokinetic model was a one compartment open model with absorption lag time representing the delay for both absorption and metabolism from inactive ( prednisone ) to active form ( prednisolone ) . This model predicted free concentrations , which were then used to calculate total concentrations based on established binding constants . RESULTS : Free prednisolone clearance ( CLu/F ) and volume of distribution ( Vu/F ) were scaled allometrically to body weight . The typical population estimates ( 95% confidence interval ) were 54 ( 48 62 ) L/h/70 kg and 235 ( 203 274 ) L/70 kg , respectively . Additionally , the bioavailability parameter was found to decrease non linearly with the dose . Prednisolone cumulative exposure was not different between patients who responded at 3 months and those who did not . CONCLUSIONS : Robust pharmacokinetic targets are not yet clearly defined regarding toxicity or efficacy and are warranted in order to make a valuable contribution to prednisolone therapeutic drug monitoring in the context of SLE .
Compartment models are widely used in fields such as epidemiology and biomedicine to describe the exchange of uniformly distributed materials between interconnected compartments . However , their application in biological fluids is limited by the assumption of infinitely large diffusivity , especially in environments such as tumors or subcutaneous tissue , where diffusion is considerably lower . To address this , we develop a diffusion aware compartment model that maintains the simplicity of traditional compartment models while offering greater accuracy . We conducted experiments on the uptake of ; 18F fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) , a radionuclide , by cells grown in culture plates and found a good agreement between the measured and predicted cellular radioactivity . We identify two critical dimensionless parameters that compare the amount of FDG ( i ) replenished by diffusion and ( ii ) available in the culture medium to the amount of FDG taken up by cells . We demonstrate that the diffusion aware compartment model reduces to the three compartment model when FDG diffusion is fast relative to cellular uptake , and it further simplifies to the two compartment model when sufficient FDG is available in the culture medium . The semianalytic solutions of the diffusion aware compartment model can be easily extended to study other scenarios , such as drug transport and bubble growth dynamics . FAU Zhong , Xiaoxu
An example system of collective behavior in the presence of active agents is the structural maintenance of chromosome ( SMC ) protein complexes within the nucleus that create an architecture to facilitate the organization and proper function of the genome . Of the diverse functions these SMC proteins are capable of producing , we focus on the creation of localized clusters of chromatin in the nucleolus through transient cross links . Large scale simulations revealed three different dynamic behaviors as a function of timescale : slow cross linking leads to no clusters , fast cross linking produces rigid slowly changing clusters , while intermediate timescales produce flexible clusters that mediate gene interaction . By mathematically analyzing different relative scalings of the two sources of stochasticity , thermal fluctuations , and the force induced by the transient cross links , we predict these three distinct regimes of cluster behavior . Standard time averaging that takes the fluctuations of the transient cross link force to zero predicts the existence of rigid clusters . Accounting for the interaction of both fluctuations from the cross links and thermal noise with an effective energy landscape predicts the timescale dependent lifetimes of flexible clusters . No clusters are predicted when the fluctuations of the transient cross link force are taken to be large relative to thermal fluctuations . This mathematical perturbation analysis illuminates the importance of accounting for stochasticity in local incoherent transient forces to predict emergent complex biological behavior .

Cellularized tissue and polymer networks can both transition from floppy to rigid as a function of their control parameters , and , yet , the two systems often mechanically interact , which could affect their respective rigidities . To study this interaction , we consider a vertex model with surface tension embedded in a spring network in two dimensions . We identify two regimes with different global spheroid shapes and governed by the pressure resulting from competition between surface tension and tension in the network . In the first regime , the tissue remains compact , while in the second , a cavitation like instability leads to the emergence of gaps at the tissue network interface . Intriguingly , compression of the tissue promotes fluidization , while tension promotes cellular alignment and rigidification with the mechanisms driving rigidification differing on either side of the instability .

The self organization of proteins into enriched compartments and the formation of complex patterns are crucial processes for life on the cellular level . Liquid liquid phase separation is one mechanism for forming such enriched compartments . When phase separating proteins are membrane bound and locally disturb it , the mechanical response of the membrane mediates interactions between these proteins . How these membrane mediated interactions influence the steady state of the protein density distribution is thus an important question to investigate in order to understand the rich diversity of protein and membrane shape patterns present at the cellular level . This work starts with a widely used model for membrane bound phase separating proteins . We numerically solve our system to map out its phase space and perform a careful , systematic expansion of the model equations to characterize the phase transitions through linear stability analysis and free energy arguments . We observe that the membrane mediated interactions , due to their long range nature , are capable of qualitatively altering the equilibrium state of the proteins . This leads to arrested coarsening and length scale selection instead of simple demixing and complete coarsening . In this study , we unambiguously show that long range membrane mediated interactions lead to pattern formation in a system that otherwise would not do so . This work provides a basis for further systematic study of membrane bound pattern forming systems . FAU Winter , Antonia
Many biological and social systems are naturally represented as edge weighted directed or undirected hypergraphs since they exhibit group interactions involving three or more system units as opposed to pairwise interactions that can be incorporated in graph theoretic representations . However , finding influential cores in hypergraphs is still not as extensively studied as their graph theoretic counterparts . To this end , we develop and implement a hypergraph curvature guided discrete time diffusion process with suitable topological surgeries and edge weight renormalization procedures for both undirected and directed weighted hypergraphs to find influential cores . We successfully apply our framework for directed hypergraphs to seven metabolic hypergraphs and our framework for undirected hypergraphs to two social ( coauthorship ) hypergraphs to find influential cores , thereby demonstrating the practical feasibility of our approach . In addition , we prove a theorem showing that a certain edge weight renormalization procedure in a prior research work for Ricci flows for edge weighted graphs has the undesirable outcome of modifying the edge weights to negative numbers , thereby rendering the procedure impossible to use . This paper formulates algorithmic approaches for finding core ( s ) of ( weighted or unweighted ) directed hypergraphs . FAU Sengupta , Prithviraj
Fermentative yeasts play important roles in both ecological and industrial processes , but their distribution and abundance in natural environments are not well understood . We investigated the diversity of yeasts at the northern range limit of their oak tree hosts ( Quercus spp . ) in Sweden , and identified climatic and ecological conditions governing their distribution . Yeasts were isolated from bark samples from 28 forests and identified to the species level using DNA metabarcoding . Most communities were dominated by species in the Saccharomycetaceae family , especially by species of Saccharomyces , Kluyveromyces and Pichia . Each genus showed a distinct latitudinal and longitudinal distribution , and both temperature and precipitation metrics predicted significant variation in their abundance . Consistent with this , laboratory assays revealed significant effects of temperature on the growth of strains collected from different longitudes and latitudes . We found that older trees harbour more diverse and more balanced fermentative yeast communities with more evenly distributed species abundances . Communities across trees were more similar when sharing a common dominant species . This work provides a baseline for future studies on the impact of climate change on the fermentative yeast biodiversity of temperate forests in northern latitudes and contributes to a growing collection of wild isolates for potential biotechnological applications .
Vanillin is the most in demand flavouring compound in the world and because vanillin extracted from vanilla pods cannot meet the global demand , most vanillin on the market today is chemically synthesised . Increasing demands by consumers for natural ingredients have inspired efforts to develop vanillin derived from microbial sources . These efforts have been challenged by low titers , likely caused by the toxicity of vanillin to most microbial biocatalysts . In this study , we engineered a Pseudomonas putida KT2440 derived strain that accumulated vanillin from ferulic acid to 64 g/L . To increase the overall titre , we applied a hydrophobic polystyrene based resin to vanillin accumulating cultures , which enabled an increase in total vanillin recovery to an apparent titre of 35 g/L . This study demonstrates that P . putida can accumulate vanillin from ferulic acid to higher titers when vanillin is removed from the cultivation medium , mitigating its toxicity .
INTRODUCTION : While immune dysfunction has been increasingly linked to Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) progression , many major innate immune signaling molecules have yet to be explored in AD pathogenesis using genetic targeting approaches . METHODS : To investigate a role for the key innate immune adaptor molecule , stimulator of interferon genes ( STING ) , in AD , we deleted Sting1 in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD related amyloidosis and evaluated the effects on pathology , neuroinflammation , gene expression , and cognition . RESULTS : Genetic ablation of STING in 5xFAD mice led to improved control of amyloid beta ( Abeta ) plaques , alterations in microglial activation status , decreased levels of neuritic dystrophy , and protection against cognitive decline . Moreover , rescue of neurological disease in STING deficient 5xFAD mice was characterized by reduced expression of type I interferon signaling genes in both microglia and excitatory neurons . DISCUSSION : These findings reveal critical roles for STING in Abeta driven neurological disease and suggest that STING targeting therapeutics may offer promising strategies to treat AD . HIGHLIGHTS : Stimulator of interferon genes ( STING ) deficiency in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer ' s disease related amyloidosis results in decreased amyloid beta ( Abeta ) deposition and altered microglial activation status . Protection against amyloidosis in STING deficient 5xFAD mice is associated with decreased expression of genes involved in type I IFN signaling , improved neuronal health , and reduced levels of oxidative stress . Loss of STING in 5xFAD mice leads to improved spatial learning and memory .
INTRODUCTION : Medical conditions prevalent in Black adults within the United States have been associated with plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 ( p tau217 ) ; however , insufficient p tau217 research has been conducted with Black adults . METHODS : Participants included n = 233 predominantly cognitively unimpaired adults enrolled in the African Americans Fighting Alzheimer ' s in Midlife study . Subsamples had creatinine ( n = 137 ) and positron emission tomography ( PET ; amyloid PET = 65 [amyloid PET positive = 16/65] ; tau PET = 70 ) . We tested whether p tau217 ( ALZPath , Inc . ) varied by medical condition and amyloid and tau PET positivity status and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of p tau RESULTS : Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) <60 mL/min/73 m , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , and amyloid and tau PET positive status demonstrated higher p tau Effect sizes ( r ( pb ) ) : eGFR <60 group = 48 , CVD = 25 , amyloid PET positive status = 54 ; tau PET positive status = Lower eGFR was related to higher p tau217 when adjusting for amyloid PET . For abnormal amyloid PET and tau PET , p tau217 exhibited areas under the curve of 90 and 89 , respectively . DISCUSSION : Plasma p tau217 showed promise as an Alzheimer ' s biomarker in Black adults ; however , kidney function and CVD should be considered when interpreting levels . HIGHLIGHTS : Plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 ( p tau217 ) was tested in a sample of Black middle aged and older adults . Level of p tau217 was higher in impaired kidney function and cardiovascular disease . Obesity and diabetes were not related to p tau Level of p tau217 was higher in amyloid and tau PET positive status . Plasma p tau217 showed good receiver operating characteristic area under the curve for abnormal amyloid and tau PET .
Significant data suggest that cerebral accumulation of the amyloid beta protein ( Abeta ) plays an initiating role in Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) , however , Abeta can exist in multiple different forms and it is not clear which of these contribute to the propagation of amyloid or toxicity . When injected into animal models , Abeta containing homogenates from AD or APP transgenic mouse brain accelerate amyloid pathology , but the nature of the seeding species remain ill defined . In this study , we took advantage of well characterized brain extracts from human AD cases and App ( NL F/NL F ) mice , to assess the seeding activity of diffusible forms of Abeta . Extracts containing readily diffusible forms of Abeta , ( which we refer to as S extracts ) are obtained by soaking tissue slices in physiological buffer and removing large non diffusing material by centrifugation . Such AD brain S extracts are potent neuritotoxins and contain a broad range of different sized forms Abeta . When tested at approximately ten months after a single intracerebral injection of AD brain S extract , App ( NL F/NL F ) mice exhibited a significant perturbation of learned behavior , together with accelerated cerebral amyloid deposition , microgliosis , astrocytosis , neuronal dystrophy and synaptic loss . Importantly , inoculation of App ( NL F/NL F ) mice with S extract from a human control brain altered neither the memory of learned behavior nor the appearance of amyloid and associated pathologies . These results indicate that diffusible forms of Abeta derived from AD brain can readily induce aggregation of endogenous Abeta and accelerate negative outcomes associated with Abeta accumulation .
Adaptor proteins play a crucial role in signal transduction by facilitating the assembly of protein complexes at specific subcellular domains . These multifunctional molecules contain multiple binding modules that enhance the efficiency and flexibility of cellular signaling pathways , thereby orchestrating complex responses . Among these proteins , Grb2 ( growth factor receptor bound protein 2 ) emerges as a key regulator owing to its unique " sandwich " structure . Despite lacking intrinsic enzymatic activity , recent investigations have revealed that Grb2 acts not merely as a passive bridge but also utilizes intramolecular allosteric communication to modulate binding specificity . In this study , we compared the kinetic binding properties of SH2 SH3 belonging to Grb2 with Gab2 and the same experiment with bound states of the SH2 domain using two different peptides that mimics the physiological ligands of SH Our results demonstrate that the SH2 domain plays a critical regulatory role , exhibiting remarkably distinct behaviors in free and bound states , and depending on the ligand it binds to . This suggests how selectivity can be modulated by intradomain allostery . In vitro functional assays measuring the activation levels of the target protein further supported our hypothesis .
BACKGROUND : Moyamoya angiopathy ( MA ) is a rare cerebrovascular disorder which can occur in both children and young adults , characterized by progressive occlusion of the intracranial carotid arteries , leading patients to ischemic and haemorrhagic strokes . Despite decades of research , the mechanisms underlying MA remain poorly clarified and current gaps in the understanding of pathogenesis have hampered the development of suitable preventive strategies and therapeutic options . Moreover , clinically approved biomarkers for MA patients ' stratification are missing . The unknown pathophysiology and the lack of reliable biomarkers prompted us to investigate cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) lipidome through state of the art lipidomics . METHODS : Intraoperative CSF from a subgroup of MA patients in comparison to age/sex matched controls ( CTRL ) was analysed through LC MS/MS , by an untargeted lipidomic approach . Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve and simple linear regression analyses were performed for diagnostic use . We searched for simultaneously altered lipids in plasma and CSF of MA patients . RESULTS : Overall , we observed a significant increase of sphingolipids ( p < 05 ) and phospholipids ( p < 05 ) in MA CSF . A partial least squares discriminant analysis clearly separated MA and CTRL by 64% on Principal Component We identified lipid classes ( n = 12 ) with a Variance Importance in Projection score >/= 5 , within those lipids highly correlated with MA ( n = 70 ) . A significant increase in acylcarnitines , sphingolipids ( sphingomyelins and ceramides ) , phospholipids ( lysophosphatidylcholines ; phosphatidylcholines ; phosphatidylethanolamines ; ether phosphatidylethanolamines ; ether phosphatidylcholines ) and cholesterol esters was found by multivariate and univariate analyses . Monoacylglycerols were the only lipid class displaying a markedly significant ( p < 001 ) decrease in CSF of MA patients as compared to CTRL subjects . The ROC curve and simple linear regression analysis identified 10 out of 12 lipid classes as reliable MA biomarkers , mainly dealing with phospholipids . We then compared current and previous data on plasma lipidomic profile . The discriminant analysis returned n = 175 ( in plasma ) and n = 70 ( in CSF ) simultaneously altered lipids respectively , and phosphatidylcholines ( n = 10 ) resulted as commonly decreased in plasma and increased in CSF . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings highlighted a strong pro inflammatory environment in MA CSF . These preliminary hallmarks could be helpful to decipher the complex MA pathogenesis , by supplying candidate biomarkers for patient stratification .

BACKGROUND : Oral cancer ( OC ) is one of the major types of cancer and the most common cause of cancer related mortality in Asia . In recent years , matrix stiffness in the tumor microenvironment has been found to play an important role in regulating tumor cell behavior . However , the regulatory mechanisms associated with matrix stiffness in OC cells remain unclear . METHODS : In this study , polyacrylamide gels with different stiffness were prepared to simulate low versus high matrix stiffness environments in tumor tissues by adjusting the acrylamide and cross linker concentrations . Subsequently , the effects of different stiffness on OC cell survival , migration , invasion and invadopodia formation were explored based on cell counting kit 8 ( CCK 8 ) , Transwell and confocal microscopy . Meanwhile , the levels of markers relevant to phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K ) /protein kinase B ( AKT ) , apoptosis ( BAX and BCL2 ) as well as metastasis ( Cadherin 1 , CDH1 ; Cadherin 2 , and CDH2 ) were calculated via western blotting and real time quantitative PCR . RESULTS : According to the results , high matrix stiffness was seen to contribute to the increased number of migrated and invaded cells as well as the enhanced viability of OC cells , along with the aggravated invadopodia formation and the up regulation in CDH2 and BCL2 levels yet the down regulation in CDH1 and BAX levels . Elevated PI3K/AKT phosphorylation levels were also seen in high matrix stiffness mediated OC cells , and the intervention using LY294002 could visibly overturned the effects of high matrix stiffness on the cell migration , invasion and invadopodia formation of OC cells . CONCLUSIONS : This study reveals that matrix stiffness may enhance the invasiveness and anti apoptotic ability of OC cells by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway , which provides a new idea for exploring the microenvironmental regulation of tumor mechanics and targeted intervention strategies .
BACKGROUND : While primary breast cancer ( BC ) is often effectively managed , metastasis remains the primary cause of BC related fatalities . Gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanisms regulating cancer cell organotropism with predilection to specific organs . Unraveling mediators of site specific metastasis could enhance early detection and enable more tailored interventions . Liquid biopsy represents an innovative approach in cancer involving the analysis of biological materials such as circulating tumor DNA and tumor derived extracellular vesicles ( EV ) found in body fluids like blood or urine . This offers valuable insights for characterizing and monitoring tumor genomes to advance personalized medicine in metastatic cancers . METHODS : We performed in depth analyses of EV cargo associated with BC metastasis using eight murine cell line models with distinct metastatic potentials and organotropism to the lung , the bone , the liver , and the brain . We characterized the secretome of these cells to identify unique biomarkers specific to metastatic sites . RESULTS : Small EVs isolated from all cell lines were quantified and validated for established EV markers . Tracking analysis and electron microscopy revealed EV secretion patterns that differed according to cell line . Cell free ( cf ) DNA and EV associated DNA ( EV DNA ) were detected from all cell lines with varying concentrations . We detected a TP53 mutation in both EV DNA and cfDNA . Mass spectrometry based proteomics analyses identified 698 EV associated proteins , which clustered according to metastatic site . This analysis highlighted both common EV signatures and proteins involved in cancer progression and organotropism unique to metastatic cell lines . Among these , 327 significantly differentially enriched proteins were quantified with high confidence levels across BC and metastatic BC cells . We found enrichment of specific integrin receptors in metastatic cancer EVs compared to EVs secreted from non transformed epithelial cells and matched tumorigenic non metastatic cells . Pathway analyses revealed that EVs derived from parental cancer cells display a cell adhesion signature and are enriched with proteins involved in cancer signaling pathways . CONCLUSION : Taken together , the characterization of EV cargo in a unique model of BC organotropism demonstrated that EV DNA and EV proteomes were informative of normal and cancer states . This work could help to identify BC biomarkers associated with site specific metastasis and new therapeutic targets .
BACKGROUND : Biological aging is a common starting point for many chronic diseases and multimorbidity . Spicy food consumption is showing a growing trend worldwide . However , the association of spicy food consumption with the comprehensive biological age ( BA ) and organ specific BAs remains unclear . METHODS : This study included 7874 participants from the China Multi Ethnic Cohort ( CMEC ) , all participating in baseline and follow up surveys . The CMEC was located in Southwest China , which has become one of the most prominent and typical regions regarding spicy food consumption in China and the world . We constructed comprehensive BA and organ specific BAs based on composite indicators using the widely validated Klemera Doubal method . The frequency of intake of spicy food was obtained by an electronic questionnaire . Follow up analyses adjusted for baseline data were then employed to assess the longitudinal associations of spicy food consumption at baseline with both the comprehensive BA and the organ specific BAs at follow up . RESULTS : Compared with non spicy consumers , spicy consumers showed a decrease in comprehensive BA acceleration , with adjusted beta = 23 ( 60 to 13 ) for 1 2 days/week , beta = 69 ( 10 to 29 ) for 3 5 days/week and 32 ( 63 to 01 ) years for 6 7 days/week , respectively . Higher estimates were observed for metabolic and kidney BA accelerations than for cardiopulmonary and liver BA accelerations . Compared to non spicy consumers , spicy consumers showed a decrease in metabolic BA acceleration ( 3 5 days/week : beta = 76 ( 28 to 24 ) years ) and kidney BA acceleration ( 3 5 days/week : beta = 89 ( 76 to 02 ) years ) . CONCLUSION : Spicy foods may have potential benefits for biological aging . Our findings highlight that spicy foods may slow comprehensive and organ specific biological aging , especially metabolic and kidney biological aging .
BACKGROUND : The prognosis of osteosarcoma has improved little over the past few decades , with radioresistance being a contributing factor . Effective radiosensitizing targets and novel mechanisms for treating osteosarcoma are urgently needed . Research on the impact of regulating differentiation levels on the radiosensitivity of malignant tumors is limited . This study aimed to explore the efficacy of ITGB3 as a novel radiosensitizing target in osteosarcoma and to explore whether the modulation of osteogenic differentiation plays a role in mediating the radiosensitizing effect . METHODS : RNA sequencing was utilized to screen for potential targets that affect the radiosensitivity of osteosarcoma . In vitro assays examining cell viability , apoptosis , proliferation , migration , and invasion were conducted to verify the radiosensitizing effect of ITGB3 knockdown ( KD ) . Furthermore , in vivo validation was performed by constructing mouse models with subcutaneous and orthotopic tibial tumors . Rescue experiments involving siRNAs and molecular inhibitors were performed to explore and validate the mechanisms through which ITGB3 KD exerts a radiosensitizing effect in vitro and in vivo . Additionally , osteogenic differentiation cultures of osteosarcoma cells were conducted as auxiliary validation for the radiosensitizing mechanism . RESULTS : ITGB3 KD had a radiosensitizing effect on osteosarcoma in vitro by inhibiting cell viability , proliferation , migration , and invasion and promoting apoptosis . ITGB3 KD radiosensitized osteosarcoma in vivo in subcutaneous and orthotopic tibial tumor models . ITGB3 KD upregulated the JNK/c JUN pathway , and rescue experiments with a JNK inhibitor revealed that the activation of this pathway was crucial for the upregulation of osteogenic markers such as RUNX2 , OCN , and OPN , as well as for promoting apoptotic pathways . siRNA based rescue experiments indicated that the upregulation of RUNX2 mediated the proapoptotic radiosensitizing effects of ITGB3 KD . Culture in osteogenic differentiation medium promoted osteosarcoma radiosensitization by enhancing the osteogenic differentiation status , working synergistically with ITGB3 KD . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings indicate that ITGB3 KD enhances radiosensitivity in osteosarcoma by promoting osteogenic differentiation and apoptosis through activation of the JNK/c JUN/RUNX2 pathway , identifying ITGB3 as a candidate therapeutic target and implicating JNK/c JUN/RUNX2 signaling as a modulatory axis for improving the response to radiation of osteosarcoma .
BACKGROUND : Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential ( CHIP ) is defined as the aging related clonal expansion of preleukemic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells . While CHIP has been studied in cardiometabolic diseases ( CMDs ) , its role in the long term progression from the absence of CMD to the development of a single CMD , cardiometabolic multimorbidity ( CMM ) , and eventual mortality remains uncertain . This study aimed to investigate the association between CHIP and gene specific CHIP subtypes with the progression of CMD transitions . METHODS : We included UK Biobank participants without CMD at baseline . The primary outcomes were the first CMD , CMM , and death . We evaluated associations between any CHIP ( variant allele fraction [VAF] >/= 2% ) , large CHIP ( VAF >/= 10% ) , and gene specific CHIP subtypes ( DNMT3 A , TET2 , ASXL1 , JAK2 , PPM1D/TP53 [DNA damage genes] , and SF3B1/SRSF2/U2 AF1 [spliceosome genes] ) with CMD transitions via multistate model analyses . We estimated multivariable adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs ) and 95% CIs with age as the time scale , and adjusted for sex , race , Townsend Deprivation Index , body mass index ( BMI ) , smoking , alcohol , physical activity , sleep duration , and hypertension . RESULTS : The study included 371 , 544 participants , with a mean age of 60 ( +/ 03 ) years , and 2% of whom were male ( CHIP : n = 11 , 570 [1%] ; large CHIP : n = 7156 [9%] ) . During a median follow up period of 49 years , 54 , 805 individuals developed at least one CMD , 8090 experienced CMM , and 26 , 218 died . In the fully adjusted multistate models , CHIP and large CHIP were associated with adjusted hazard ratios ( HR ) of 11 ( 95% CI 07 16 ) and 14 ( 95% CI 08 20 ) , respectively , for transitioning from a CMD free condition to a single CMD . The mortality risk associations were strongest , with adjusted HR of 45 ( 95% CI 36 55 ) and 64 ( 95% CI 52 77 ) for those without CMD , 39 ( 95% CI 26 54 ) and 59 ( 95% CI 41 79 ) for individuals with single CMD , and 58 ( 95% CI 31 91 ) and 61 ( 95% CI 29 02 ) for those with CMM . No significant association was observed with CMM development . Gene specific analyses identified DNMT3 A , TET2 , DNA damage genes , and spliceosome genes as the primary contributors to increased CMD risk . While CHIP showed no association with CMM progression , spliceosome genes were linked to a 72 fold higher risk ( adjusted HR 72 , 95% CI 14 59 ) of recurrent CMD events . All CHIP subtypes were strongly related to a heightened risk of mortality , with JAK2 presenting the highest adjusted odds ratio at 79 ( 95% CI 12 2 ) . CONCLUSIONS : CHIP serves as an independent risk factor for transitioning to the first CMD incidence and for mortality but is not associated with CMM development . CHIP targeted management may represent a promising strategy for the primary prevention of CMD and for reducing mortality risk .
BACKGROUND : Podocytes are a crucial component of the glomerular filtration barrier , and changes in their 3D structure contribute to over 80% of chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) cases . Exosomal small RNAs play a key role in cell cell communication in CKD and may serve as nanocarriers for delivering small RNAs into podocytes . However , the uptake of exosomal cargo by podocytes remains poorly understood . This study explores the use of isolated exosomes , directly transfected with fluorescently labeled small RNAs , for tracking and delivering small RNAs to cultured podocytes . METHODS : Exosomes were isolated from immortalized murine podocytes and transfected with Cy3 labeled siRNA and miRNA controls using the ExoFect siRNA/miRNA Transfection Kit . We characterized the transfected exosomes via transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and Western blot for exosomal markers CD9 and TSG Subsequently , we co cultured these exosomes with podocytes and used confocal laser scanning microscopy ( cLSM ) , and structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) to visualize cargo uptake , confirmed through flow cytometry , imaging flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining for Rab5 , Rab7 , and CD The isolated exosomes were also transfected with pre miR 21 and filamin A ( FlnA ) siRNAs before being co cultured with podocytes . We confirmed the efficiency of transfection and knockdown using RT qPCR , Western blotting , and immunofluorescence staining . RESULTS : TEM revealed that the exosomes maintained a consistent shape and size of approximately 20 nm posttransfection and exhibited a stable expression of CD9 and TSG Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence imaging showed that podocytes take up Cy3 labeled exosomal miRNAs and siRNAs time dependently , utilizing various mechanisms , including encapsulation within vesicular structures , endocytosis and free distribution within the cells . Transfection of exosomes with FlnA siRNAs resulted in a significant 8 fold reduction of filamin A expression in co cultured podocytes , while pre miR 21 transfected exosomes led to a remarkable 338 fold increase in mature miR 21 levels . CONCLUSIONS : These findings demonstrate that direct exosome transfection with fluorescently labeled small RNAs is an effective method for tracking exosomal cargo in podocytes . This study is the first to show that directly transfected exosomes can deliver small RNAs to podocytes in vitro , suggesting their potential as RNA carriers for therapeutic strategies in more complex settings .
BACKGROUND : Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is a complex endocrine characterized by hyperandrogenism , hormonal imbalances , and metabolic disruptions , leading to reproductive complications and increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases . While lifestyle modifications are the cornerstone of PCOS management , pharmacological interventions , including metformin , oral contraceptives , and anti androgens , are commonly utilized . Recently , glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonists ( GLP 1 RAs ) and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors ( SGLT2is ) have shown promising results in PCOS management . METHODS : This study conducted a comprehensive review of randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of GLP 1 RAs and SGLT2is in women with PCOS . A systematic literature search was performed , and network meta analysis using random effects model that generated mixed treatment comparison estimates was employed to assess the comparative efficacy of these drug classes on clinical ( menstrual frequency , pregnancy rate and proportion of patients with regular menstrual cycles ) , anthropometric , hormonal , and metabolic parameters . Additionally , a systematic review of preclinical studies investigating GLP 1 RAs and SGLT2is in animal models of PCOS was undertaken . RESULTS : This comprehensive meta analysis included 27 RCTs ( 1642 participants ) . GLP 1 RAs ( alone and in combination with metformin ) were observed to improve menstrual frequencies . GLP 1 RAs showed significant reductions in all anthropometric parameters , while SGLT2is was observed to improve wait hip ratio ( WHR ) and android gynoid fat ( AGF ) ratio ( in addition to reduced body weight observed with SGLT2is/metformin combination ) . Reductions in WHR and AGF ratio were better with SGLT2is compared to GLP 1 RAs . The combination of GLP 1 RAs and SGLT2is was observed to have superior efficacy in reducing body weight , percent fat mass , and AGF ratio compared to GLP 1 RAs alone . Regarding hormonal parameters , GLP 1 RAs were observed with significant improvement in free androgen index ( FAI ) , free testosterone , androstenedione , and sex hormone binding globulin levels . SGLT2is was observed with significant improvements in FAI and total testosterone , outperforming GLP 1 RAs in reducing these parameters . Regarding metabolic parameters , GLP 1 RAs significantly improved triglycerides , markers of insulin resistance and fasting and postprandial plasma glucose . SGLT2is was associated with significant improvements in homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance ( HOMA IR ) and fasting plasma glucose , and in combination with metformin , SGLT2is significantly improved triglycerides . SGLT2is outperformed GLP 1 RAs in reducing LDL cholesterol and HOMA IR . The combination of SGLT2is and GLP 1 RAs was better than GLP 1 RAs in reducing triglycerides and fasting plasma glucose . However , the strength of evidence for these findings was very low . Systematic assessment of animal studies revealed a potential association of several molecular pathways , including AMPK alpha , SIRT1 , FDX , PI3K/AKT , endothelial adhesion molecules ( VCAM , ICAM , and E selectin ) , STAR , and CYP17A1 , with the therapeutic effects of GLP 1 RAs and SGLT2is in PCOS . Both drug classes were associated with significant improvements in ovarian morphology in animal studies . CONCLUSION : This systematic review and meta analysis advance our understanding of GLP 1 RAs and SGLT2is in PCOS management . While both drug classes demonstrate efficacy in metabolic parameters , their distinct mechanisms offer unique therapeutic advantages . SGLT2is excel in improving hormonal profiles and insulin resistance , whereas GLP 1 RAs show consistent benefits in weight management . The enhanced efficacy of combination therapy suggests a potential paradigm shift in PCOS treatment strategies , moving beyond traditional monotherapy approaches . These findings support the therapeutic potential of both drug classes , individually or combined , in PCOS management , providing a foundation for more personalized treatment approaches .
BACKGROUND : In the present study , we intended to discover predictive or prognostic factors of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) . We intended to investigate the differences between PDAC cases that are treated with upfront surgery ( UFS ) and surgery after neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy ( NAT ) , and cases with good and poor responses to NAT , using digital spatial profiling ( DSP ) and immunohistochemical ( IHC ) analysis . METHODS : Forty eight PDAC cases that were surgically resected with or without NAT were included . A tissue microarray was constructed for DSP and IHC . Pathological tumor regression to NAT was graded based on the College of American Pathologists ( CAP ) system . RESULTS : Between the UFS and NAT groups , there were no significant differentially expressed genes in all cell types . In the NAT group , MFAP4 and EGR3 were upregulated in CAP 2 in pan CK and CD45 negative cells . Gene set enrichment analysis of CD45 positive cells showed that genes related to B or T cell associated pathways were enriched in CAP 2 , which correlated with the IHC ; higher CD3 , CD4 , and CD8 positive cell densities in CAP Multivariate analysis revealed age , high monocyte infiltration , and high CD68 positive cell infiltration as independent prognostic factors for overall survival . CONCLUSIONS : Increased expression of MFAP4 and EGR3 as well as high CD3 , CD4 , and CD8 positive cell infiltration may be predictive markers of the NAT response in PDAC . Additionally , high monocyte infiltration and high CD68 positive cell infiltration could serve as prognostic markers for PDAC .
AIM : This study aims to predict risk factors for hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) using continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) and with time in range ( TIR ) > 70% . METHODS : Data from 111 patients with T2DM who underwent CGM with TIR > 70% were analyzed . A hypoglycemia episode was defined as CGM detected glucose < 9mmol/L sustained for at least 5 min . Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between hypoglycemia and mean blood glucose ( MBG ) , glycemic variability ( GV ) metrics [including mean amplitude of glucose excursion ( MAGE ) , largest amplitude of glycemic excursion ( LAGE ) , mean of daily difference ( MODD ) , coefficient of variation ( CV ) , standard deviation ( SD ) ] , and low blood glucose index ( LBGI ) . A nomogram model was constructed , and its diagnostic performance was assessed . Data were bootstrapped 1000 times for internal validation , and a calibration curve was drawn to evaluate the model ' s predictive ability . Decision curve analysis was performed to assess its clinical usefulness . RESULTS : Among the 111 included patients , 53 experienced hypoglycemic event during wearing CGM ( 75% ) . GV metrics were higher in hypoglycemia group , while MBG was lower . The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the MBG , GV metrics , LBGI were independently associated with hypoglycemia . The receiver operating characteristics ( ROC ) analysis indicated that the area under the curve ( AUC ) for the MBG SD LBGI model was 93 ( 95% CI = 88 97 ) . The calibration curve showed good consistency between the predicted and observed probabilities . Decision curve analysis demonstrated strong clinical applicability . CONCLUSION : This study demonstrates a significant correlation between CGM metrics and hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM who achieved TIR > 70% . These findings suggest that CGM metrics can predict the risk of hypoglycemia in T2DM patients with a TIR > 70% , and the nomogram developed from these metrics holds strong potential for clinical application .
Asthma is a chronic disease with typical pathological features such as airflow limitation , airway inflammation and remodeling . Of these , neutrophilic asthma is considered to be the more severe and corticosteroid resistant subtype of asthma . Increasing evidence suggests that patients with neutrophilic asthma often accompany with dysbiosis of the internal microbiota , where the increased abundance of non typeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHi ) is closely related to the neutrophilic asthma phenotype . Furthermore , emerging evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are pivotal in the pathogenesis of neutrophilic asthma . In this study , matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP 9 ) responsive , catalase loaded nanogels ( M CAT NGs ) were synthesized , which was composed of MMP 9 sensitive peptide ( VPMS ) , arginine grafted chitosan and maleimide ( CS Arg Mal ) , catalase ( CAT ) , sodium citrate ( SC ) and epsilon poly ( L lysine ) ( epsilon PLL ) . The M CAT NGs showed potent antimicrobial effects and exerted excellent therapeutic effects in the presence of MMP 9 by causing VPMS rupture and responsive release of CAT . In vitro experiments revealed that M CAT NGs effectively inhibited the proliferation of NTHi , Staphylococcus aureus ( S . aureus ) , and Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) , while also demonstrating the capacity to modulate the inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and hydrogen peroxide ( HO ) stimulation . In vivo experiments demonstrated that nebulized inhalation of M CAT NGs was effective in reducing airway hyperresponsiveness ( AHR ) , alleviating inflammation , downregulating the expression level of ROS in the lung tissues , thus enabling the effective management of neutrophilic asthma . Thus , the development of M CAT NGs has shown strong potential for the clinical management of neutrophilic asthma by modulating the inflammatory response .
BACKGROUND : Endometrial cancer ( EC ) is a significant and serious gynecological cancer , constituting a considerable risk to women ' s health . The desumoylation of SUMO specific peptidase 5 ( SENP5 ) is intricately linked with various cancers . Nonetheless , the function of SENP5 in EC and its regulation of EC progression through the related mechanism of desumoylation modification remain elusive . METHODS : Five samples of EC tumor tissues , along with para cancerous tissues , were obtained . The expression of SENP5 in EC was assessed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT qPCR ) , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , and Western blot . HEC 1 B cells were treated with liposomes to interfere SENP5 and/or beta catenin expression . The methodologies employed to assess the impact of SENP5 on the proliferation of EC cells via beta catenin included RT qPCR , Western blot , CCK8 , EDU , and C11 BODIPY methods . Western blot , co immunoprecipitation ( CO IP ) , and SUMOylation analysis were conducted to investigate the desumoylation modification of beta catenin by SENP RESULTS : SENP5 exhibited elevated expression levels in EC cancer tissues and was correlated with a negative prognosis for patients diagnosed with EC . The suppression of SENP5 inhibited the expression of beta catenin and GPX4 , activated ferroptosis , and inhibited HEC 1 B cell proliferation . Knockdown of beta catenin counteracted the impact of SENP5 overexpression on ferroptosis and HEC 1 B proliferation . In addition , SENP5 stabilized beta catenin level in HEC 1 B cells through desumoylation modification of the beta catenin protein . CONCLUSIONS : SENP5 promotes GPX4 mediated ferroptosis resistance , thereby enhancing the proliferation of EC cells by regulating beta catenin desumoylation , this finding indicates that SENP5 may serve as a promising target for therapeutic interventions in the treatment of EC .
Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is an endocrine metabolic syndrome characterized by ovulation disorders , hyperandrogenemia , and polycystic ovaries , which seriously affect the psychological and physical health of childbearing women . N6 methyladenosine ( m6A ) , as the most common mRNA epigenetic modification in eukaryotes , is vital for developing the female reproductive system and reproductive diseases . In recent years , an increasing number of studies have revealed the mechanisms by which m6A modifications and their related proteins are promoting the development of PCOS , including writers , erasers and readers . In this work , we reviewed the research progress of m6A in the pathophysiological development of PCOS from the starting point of PCOS clinical features , included the recent studies or those with significant findings related to m6A and PCOS , summarized the current commonly used therapeutic methods in PCOS and the possible targeted therapies against the m6A mechanism , and looked forward to future research directions of m6A in PCOS . With the gradual revelation of the m6A mechanism , m6A and its related proteins are expected to become a great field for PCOS treatment .
Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the sixth most prevalent malignancy worldwide , and represents a major global health challenge . While surgical resection at early stages offers favorable prognosis with 5 year survival rates exceeding 70% , the clinical reality in China reveals a contrasting scenario , where over 60% of patients present with advanced disease , resulting in a dramatic decline in 5 year survival to below 5% . The immunological landscape plays a pivotal role in HCC pathogenesis and progression , comprising two complementary arms : the innate immune system ' s rapid response mechanism for immediate tumor surveillance and the adaptive immune system ' s antigen specific targeting with immunological memory capabilities . Emerging evidence has highlighted ubiquitination , a sophisticated post translational modification system , as a critical regulator of immune homeostasis in HCC pathogenesis . This molecular process exerts precise control through three primary mechanisms : Modulation of immune cell activation thresholds via proteasomal degradation of signaling proteins , Orchestrating immune cell differentiation through stability regulation of transcriptional factors , and Maintenance of immune tolerance by dynamic modification of checkpoint regulators . Such multifaceted regulation affects both innate immune recognition pathways ( e . g . , NF kappaB and STING signaling ) and adaptive immune effectors ( particularly T cell receptor signaling cascades ) . This comprehensive review establishes a threefold Objective : First , to elucidate the mechanistic interplay between ubiquitination networks and HCC related immune dysregulation ; Second , to systematically analyze how innate immune associated ubiquitination events drive hepatocarcinogenesis through chronic inflammation modulation ; and third , to critically evaluate recent clinical advances combining ubiquitination targeted therapies ( e . g . , proteasome inhibitors and E3 ligase modulators ) with immunotherapeutic regimens . Our synthesis revealed that strategic manipulation of ubiquitination pathways can potentiate PD 1/PD L1 blockade efficacy while mitigating therapeutic resistance , particularly through modulation of tumor associated macrophages and exhausted T cell populations . By integrating fundamental mechanistic insights with translational clinical data , this review provides a conceptual framework for the development of next generation diagnostic biomarkers and rational therapeutic combinations . The proposed strategy of ubiquitination immune axis modulation holds significant potential to transform current HCC management paradigms , offering new avenues for precision immunotherapy for this challenging malignancy .
BACKGROUND : Mitochondria are very dynamic organelles that maintain cellular homeostasis , crucial in the central nervous system . Mitochondrial abnormalities have been described in neuropsychiatric diseases , namely major depression disorder ( MDD ) and schizophrenia . Since stress is the predominant non genetic cause of MDD , and has a direct impact on mitochondrial networks , understanding how psychological stress affects mitochondrial health is vital to improve the current pharmacological therapies . METHODS : The effect of 21 days of unpredictable stress was evaluated in frontal cortex of Wistar male rats comparing protein and gene markers of mitophagy ( PINK1 , PARKIN , BNIP3 , NIX , FUNDC1 ) , mitochondrial biosynthesis ( PGC1alpha , NRF1 , TFAM ) and dynamics ( MFN1 , MFN2 , OPA1 , DRP1 ) , and mitochondrial presence within microglia with the MitoTracker Green FM probe . RESULTS : Chronic mild stress ( CMS ) caused the upregulation of mitochondrial mass , mitochondria depolarization , dysregulation in mitochondrial dynamics towards fusion , the increase of mitophagy markers and the induction of genes that activate mitochondrial biogenesis in frontal cortex . CMS also promoted microglia recruitment and mitochondrial number boosting within them . CONCLUSIONS : There is a dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics towards fusion , an upregulation of mitophagy markers , and the induction of genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis in response to CMS in the frontal cortex of adult rats . This study highlights the impact of psychological stress on brain mitochondrial networks .
BACKGROUND : The salivary glands of female ticks rapidly degenerate after feeding via programmed cell death mediated by an ecdysteroid receptor ( ECR ) . The degeneration includes both apoptosis and autophagy . The process of degeneration can also be regulated by microRNAs ( miRNAs ) , but the underlying mechanism of miRNA involvement in salivary gland degeneration remains incompletely understood . Here , we demonstrate that microRNA34 5p ( miR 34 5p ) regulates the process of salivary gland degeneration in Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides by modulating the target gene RhECR . METHODS : Dual luciferase reporter assays and phenotypic rescue experiments identified RhECR as a direct target of miR 34 5p . The overexpression and inhibition of miR 34 5p were quantified by hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling ( TUNEL ) staining . RESULTS : The results showed that miR 34 5p inhibited the expression of RhECR to retard apoptosis in salivary gland acini . The study identified the roles of miR 34 5p and RhECR and their interactions in tick salivary gland degeneration . CONCLUSIONS : The findings will aid in the application of ECR genes for tick control .
One Health seeks to integrate and balance the health of humans , animals , and environmental systems , which are intricately linked through microbiomes . These microbial communities exchange microbes and genes , influencing not only human and animal health but also key environmental , agricultural , and biotechnological processes . Preventing the emergence of pathogens as well as monitoring and controlling the composition of microbiomes through microbial effectors including virulence factors , toxins , antibiotics , non ribosomal peptides , and viruses holds transformative potential . However , the mechanisms by which these microbial effectors shape microbiomes and their broader functional consequences for host and ecosystem health remain poorly understood . Metaproteomics offers a novel methodological framework as it provides insights into microbial dynamics by quantifying microbial biomass composition , metabolic functions , and detecting effectors like viruses , antimicrobial resistance proteins , and non ribosomal peptides . Here , we highlight the potential of metaproteomics in elucidating microbial effectors and their impact on microbiomes and discuss their potential for modulating microbiomes to foster desired functions .
BACKGROUND : Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) is a significant public health concern associated with high morbidity and mortality rates , particularly in populations with type 2 diabetes and hypertension . Advanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) are implicated in CKD pathogenesis , but their association with the estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) remains unclear . We aimed to assess the associations between AGE levels and the eGFR . METHODS : We conducted a cross sectional analysis of baseline data from the Health Workers Cohort Study ( 2004 2006 ) , which included 1 , 621 adults . AGE levels were categorized into quartiles , and the eGFR was calculated via the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration ( CKD EPI ) 2009 equation . Quantile and logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between AGEs and the eGFR , adjusting for potential confounders . RESULTS : The median AGE level was 334 microU/ml , and the prevalence of low eGFR ( < 60 mL/min/73 m ) was 7% . Quantile regression analysis revealed a significant reduction in the eGFR , particularly in the 10th percentile . Logistic regression models revealed that a 100 microU/ml increase in AGE level was associated with increased odds of a low eGFR ( OR : 06 , 95% CI : 03 09 ) . Participants with very high AGE levels had greater odds of having a low eGFR than those in the lowest category did ( OR : 21 , 95% CI : 00 88 ) . CONCLUSION : Elevated AGE levels were associated with lower eGFRs and increased odds of low eGFRs . These findings underscore the potential role of AGEs in CKD development and suggest the importance of targeting AGE accumulation for CKD prevention and management in high risk populations .
BACKGROUND : The interplay between diet and healthspan is a topic of great interest in biomedical research . Toward this end , consumption of marine omega 3 fatty acids is of particular significance , as reports suggest that diets focused on seafood can prolong the disease free portion of the human lifespan . Fish consumption has also been linked to reduced biological aging as measured by epigenetic clocks , but there is no conclusive evidence of a causal relationship . Moreover , fish oils reduce triglycerides , and may affect other lipid profiles , as well as systemic inflammation . To investigate further , we used two sample Mendelian randomization to investigate potential causality between fish intake and healthspan markers . METHODS : Bidirectional Mendelian randomization was performed in the two sample setting with publicly available GWAS summary statistics . GWAS data from the UK Biobank for oily fish consumption ( n = 460 , 443 ) and fish oil supplementation ( n = 461 , 384 ) were used as the primary exposures . First generation epigenetic clocks Hannum age and intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration ( IEAA ) , as well as second generation clocks GrimAge and PhenoAge were collected from an independent dataset of individuals of European ancestry ( n = [34 , 449 34 , 667] ) . Finally , data from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit database was used for serum proxies of lipidemia and systemic inflammation ( n = [61 , 308 78 , 700] ) . Additional sensitivity analyses , such as reverse causation testing and the Cochran ' s Q test were performed for exposure outcome pairs where the inverse variance weighted ( IVW ) method was significant ( p value < 05 ) , and where the MR Egger method indicated an effect in the same direction as the IVW result . RESULTS : We report that oily fish consumption appears to decrease PhenoAge acceleration ( p < 0086 ) , whereas fish oil supplementation appears to decrease GrimAge ( p = 037 ) . Both omega 3 exposures modify the epigenetic clocks in the expected negative , or age decelerating , direction . For the serum biomarkers , we find evidence that fish oil consumption leads to a reduction in triglycerides ( p = 004 ) , although HDL and LDL were not significantly modified . Finally , we also detected a suggestive inverse relationship between oily fish consumption and hsCRP ( p = 064 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Our analysis shows that consuming fish oil , whether through whole food or as a supplement , can have a rejuvenating impact as measured by PhenoAge and GrimAge acceleration . We have also provided evidence further linking fish oil intake and lower triglyceride levels . These results , based on robust MR based analyses , emphasize the effectiveness of dietary choices in modifying emerging measures of healthspan .
BACKGROUND : The tumor microenvironment ( TME ) supplies critical metabolites that support cancer cell survival and progression . Adipocytes support tumor progression by secreting free fatty acids ( FFAs ) and adipokines ; however , the role and mechanisms underlying lipid droplet ( LD ) release from adipocytes remain elusive . METHODS : Using two nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) cell lines and primary human pre adipocytes ( HPA ) , we evaluate the effect of LDs on cell growth , proliferation , colony formation , and migration . We also assess the roles of LD on the tumor progression in vivo . Using RNA seq analysis , we elucidate the effect of hypoxic NPC cell derived exosomes ( H exo ) on the gene expression profile of adipocytes . By co culture system , we investigated the effect of vacuolar protein sorting 4 homolog B ( VPS4B ) annexin A5 ( ANXA5 ) interaction on adipocyte LD maturity and release . RESULTS : Herein , we report that LDs , rather than FFAs , are the primary lipid form transferred from adipocytes to NPC cells , enhancing cancer progression . NPC cells internalize LDs directly via macropinocytosis , while H exo induces oxidative stress and membrane fluidity in adipocytes , leading to LD release . Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal that VPS4B triggers LD release by interacting with ANXA5 , and low LKB1 in H exo enhances VPS4B O linked N acetylglucosamine ( O GlcNAc ) modification through the inhibition of serine/threonine kinase 11 ( STK11/LKB1 ) AMP activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) pathway and activation of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway ( HBP ) flux . CONCLUSIONS : This study uncovers critical mechanisms of LD transfer in the TME , suggesting new therapeutic avenues in NPC .
PURPOSE : Kidney stones ( KS ) disease is a growing global health concern , increasing prevalence . Its well established associations with metabolic disorders such as diabetes and hypertension , but the relationship between frailty and KS remains underexplored . This study aims to investigate the association between KS and frailty among adults aged 20 years and older population . METHODS : This study investigates the relationship between frailty and KS prevalence using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) from 2007 to Frailty was assessed using the Frailty Index ( FI ) , a continuous variable based on 49 health deficits , and categorized into robust , pre frail , and frail states . Weighted logistic regression and restricted cubic splines ( RCS ) were used to assess the association between KS and frailty . RESULTS : A total of 28 , 113 people were included in the study , and the overall prevalence of KS occurrence was 576% . The FI in the KS group was higher than that in the no KS group [142 ( 094 216 ) vs 112 ( 073 172 ) , p < 0001] . Furthermore , the rate of frail status ( 691% vs 791% , p < 0001 ) and pre frail status ( 267% vs 929% , p < 0001 ) in the KS group were higher than that in the no KS group . Multivariate logistic regression models revealed a significant positive association between frailty and KS prevalence , with frail individuals showing a 731 fold increased likelihood compared to robust individuals ( 95% CI 406 131 , p < 0001 ) . A nonlinear relationship was observed between the FI and KS occurrence , with likelihood increasing as frailty levels rose . Subgroup analyses indicated that frailty had the greatest impact on KS likelihood in individuals under 60 years , of normal weight , and without hypertension . CONCLUSIONS : In adults in the United States , increased frailty is strongly associated with a higher likelihood of developing KS . Early identification and targeted management of frailty could play a crucial role in reducing the prevalence and recurrence of KS .
BACKGROUND : Deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 ( DADA2 ) is a rare monogenic autoinflammatory disease mainly characterized by the presence of systemic inflammation and vascular manifestations such as vasculitis and early onset stroke . Raynaud ' s phenomenon ( RP ) can occur in up to 22% of DADA2 patients . The aim of this work was to investigate the microvascular status of DADA2 patients by the mean of nailfold videocapillaroscopy ( NVC ) comparing them with adequate healthy controls ( HC ) and primary RP patients . FINDINGS : NVC data of 9 DADA2 patients ( mean age 18 +/ 6 y ) followed at the Children Gaslini Institute were retrospectively retrieved and compared to age and sex cross matched 11 HCs and 7 with primary RP patients . The NVC parameters were classified according to the EULAR SG Fast Track Algorithm and distinguished between scleroderma pattern ( giant capillaries and/or loss of capillaries combined with abnormally shaped capillaries ) and non scleroderma patterns ( non specific NVC alterations ) . In all DADA2 patients , NVC showed the presence of non specific alterations ( capillaries with dilations in 100% of cases , abnormal shapes in 23% and microhaemorrhages in 11% of patients ) . The capillary density was normal and no scleroderma pattern was found . Between DADA2 , RP patients and HC , no significant differences in the rate of each microvascular finding were detected ( p values NS ) . CONCLUSIONS : This is the first report on NVC in DADA2 patients . Only non specific abnormalities were found , characterized mainly by capillaries ' dilations , but in the absence of giant capillaries . However , larger studies are needed to definitively disclose the microvascular status in DADA2 disease .
BACKGROUND : On the basis of the contribution of the gut microbiota to hypertension development , a novel strategy involving fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) has been proposed to treat hypertension , but its efficacy has not been investigated in the clinic . METHODS : In a randomized , blinded , placebo controlled clinical trial ( 2021/03 2021/12 , ClinicalTrials . gov , NCT04406129 ) , hypertensive patients were recruited from seven centers in China , and received FMT or placebo capsules orally at three visits . The patients were randomized at a 1 : 1 ratio in blocks of four and stratified by center by an independent statistician . The intention to treat principle was implemented , as all randomized participants who received at least one intervention were included . The primary outcome was the decrease in office systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) from baseline to the day 30 visit . Adverse events ( AEs ) were recorded through the 3 month follow up to assess safety measures . Alterations in BP , the fecal microbiome , and the plasma metabolome were assessed via exploratory analyses . RESULTS : This study included 124 patients ( mean age 43 years , 4% men ) who received FMT ( n = 63 ) or placebo ( n = 61 ) capsules . The numbers of participants who experienced AEs ( 13 ( 6% ) vs . 9 ( 8% ) , p = 39 ) and the primary outcome ( 28 ( 83 ) vs . 77 ( 06 ) mmHg , p = 62 ) were comparable between the groups . The FMT group presented a decrease in SBP after 1 week of FMT , with a between arm difference of 34 ( 95% CI , 1 to 58 ; p = 024 ) mmHg , but this difference did not persist even after repeated intervention . After FMT , shifts in microbial richness and structure were identified and the abundance of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was altered . Decreases in the abundances of Eggerthella lenta , Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum , Anaerostipes hadrus , Gemella haemolysans , and Streptococcus vestibularis and increases in the abundances of Parabacteroides merdae , Prevotella copri , Bacteroides galacturonicus , Eubacterium sp . CAG 180 , Desulfovibrio piger , Megamonas hypermegale , Collinsella stercoris , Coprococcus catus , and Allisonella histaminiformans were identified and correlated with office SBP . Those species were also correlated with responding and inversely office SBP associated metabolites including tyrosine , glutamine , aspartate , phenylalanine , methionine , serine , sarcosine , and/or asparagine . CONCLUSIONS : Safety but unsustainable BP reduction was observed in the first trial of the effects of FMT on hypertension . Additional intervention studies on specific microbes with metabolite targeting and BP modulating features are needed . Video Abstract .
Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease ( MASLD ) is a growing public health concern linked to the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome , including obesity and type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . MASLD remains a significant clinical challenge due to the absence of effective therapeutic interventions . Intermittent fasting ( IF ) has emerged as a promising non pharmacological strategy for managing MASLD . Although the exact mechanisms underpinning the possible beneficial effects of IF on MASLD are not yet fully elucidated , the gut microbiota and its metabolic byproducts are increasingly recognized as potential mediators of these effects . The gut liver axis may act as an important conduit through which IF exerts its beneficial influence on hepatic function . This review comprehensively examines the impact of various IF protocols on gut microbiota composition , investigating the resultant alterations in microbial diversity and metabolomic profiles , and their potential implications for liver health and the improvement of MASLD .
BACKGROUND : Sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor 3 ( S1PR3 ) has been implicated in promoting tumor progression in various cancers . However , the role and molecular mechanisms of S1PR3 in oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) remain poorly understood . The aims of this study were to investigate the function of S1PR3 in OSCC progression and its potential as a therapeutic target . METHOD : The expression of S1PR3 was determined through qPCR , Western blotting analysis , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , and the TCGA database . The correlation between S1PR3 expression and clinical prognosis was analyzed using the TCGA database and IHC . The effects of S1PR3 on OSCC cell proliferation and cell cycle were investigated through CCK 8 assay , colony formation assay , EdU incorporation assay , cell cycle analysis , and a xenograft mouse model . The potential mechanisms through which S1PR3 affects the OSCC cell cycle were explored using RNA seq and a cell cycle array . The effects of combining S1PR3 antagonist with cisplatin on OSCC cell growth were examined through CCK 8 and EdU incorporation assays . RESULTS : S1PR3 was overexpressed in OSCC and the upregulation of S1PR3 in OSCC was correlated with unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics and adverse prognosis . Targeting S1PR3 reduced AKT phosphorylation , which led to a downregulation of WEE1 , a kinase involved in cell cycle regulation . This downregulation resulted in reducing CDC2 phosphorylation , disrupting the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint and inhibiting OSCC cell proliferation . Furthermore , the combination of S1PR3 antagonist exhibited synergistic inhibitory effects on OSCC cell growth when combined with cisplatin . CONCLUSIONS : These findings reveal a critical role for S1PR3 in regulating OSCC cell cycle via the AKT/WEE1/CDC2 pathway , thus offering a basis for developing treatment strategies for OSCC patients .
BACKGROUND : Antiphospholipid syndrome ( APS ) is an autoimmune disease primarily manifested by recurrent thrombosis and pregnancy related complications . The migration and invasion abilities of trophoblast cells play a crucial role in maintaining normal pregnancy . It is now increasingly recognized that adverse pregnancy outcomes in APS are associated with the disruption of trophoblast function by aPL ( antiphospholipid antibodies ) , rather than thrombotic occlusion of the placental vasculature . Therefore , this article aimed to explore the potential mechanisms by which aPL affect trophoblast cell function . METHOD : An APS cell model was established in the HTR 8 trophoblast cell line , followed by RNA sequencing to identify key genes involved in trophoblast cell function . To explore the underlying mechanisms , we employed quantitative real time PCR , Western blotting , immunohistochemistry , ELISA , plasmid transfection and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis . Functional assays , including migration and invasion tests , were conducted to evaluate trophoblast cell ability . Clinical samples were collected , and the expression levels of target molecules in serum were quantified using ELISA . Additionally , an APS animal pregnancy model was developed to assess pregnancy loss rates and analyze the expression of specific target genes in the placenta . RESULTS : Sequencing analysis revealed significant downregulation of MMP1 in the APS model , confirmed by qPCR and Western blotting . Correspondingly , migration and invasion of HTR 8 cells were impaired in the APS group , but MMP1 overexpression restored trophoblast cell function . Serum MMP1 levels were lower in APS patients than in controls . In the animal pregnancy model , the APS group exhibited higher pregnancy loss , with placental immunohistochemistry confirming decreased MMP1 expression . KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes between the NC and APS groups revealed a significant difference in the MAPK pathway , with P JNK showing the most notable reduction . C Jun , a downstream regulator of JNK , also decreased and modulated MMP1 expression . Notably , Anisomycin treatment increased P C Jun , upregulated MMP1 , and enhanced trophoblast migration and invasion . CONCLUSION : APL downregulated MMP1 expression by suppressing the JNK/C Jun signaling pathway in trophoblast cells , thereby reducing their migratory and invasive capabilities . This represent a potential pathogenic mechanism contributing to adverse pregnancy outcomes in APS patients , highlighting possible therapeutic targets for intervention in APS management .
BACKGROUND : Bone marrow adipose tissue ( BMAT ) plays an essential role in skeletal health and systemic metabolism , particularly under conditions of ageing and osteoporosis . Despite increasing recognition of BMAT as an active endocrine organ , the molecular mechanisms underlying its formation and expansion remain incompletely understood . METHODS : We conducted a transcriptomic re analysis of publicly available datasets focused on the adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells ( BMSCs ) . Differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to identify key molecular changes . Validation was conducted at both the transcript and protein levels . Furthermore , re analysis of single cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA seq ) data was employed to determine the cell type specific expression of candidate genes within the bone marrow . Functional assays using RNA interference were carried out to investigate the role of glutathione peroxidase 3 ( GPx3 ) in adipogenesis . RESULTS : Our analysis revealed a consistent activation of oxidative stress related pathways during adipogenic differentiation . Among the upregulated antioxidant enzymes , GPx3 was selectively increased during adipogenic but not osteogenic differentiation . This pattern was validated at both mRNA and protein levels in vitro . scRNA seq analysis showed that GPx3 expression is predominantly localized in BMSCs and adipocytes , with reduced expression observed in aged mice , corresponding to elevated levels of adipocyte related genes . In vitro functional experiments demonstrated that GPx3 knockdown significantly promoted adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs . CONCLUSION : These findings indicate that GPx3 is closely associated with adipocyte lineage commitment within the bone marrow microenvironment and may serve as a key modulator of BMSC fate . This study underscores the potential role of antioxidant enzymes such as GPx3 in the regulation of age related bone fat imbalance and highlights their relevance in metabolic bone disorders .
BACKGROUND : Obesity is highly overrepresented in patients with psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) and associated with increased disease activity and inferior treatment outcome . We have previously reported in 41 patients with PsA and body mass index ( BMI ) >/= 33 kg/m that weight loss treatment with Very Low Energy Diet ( VLED ) resulted in a median weight loss of 18 , 6% and concomitantly a significant improvement in C reactive protein ( CRP ) and disease activity at six months ( M6 ) . This sub study analyzes the effects on serum biomarkers associated with inflammation , bone and cartilage metabolism in the same PsA patients and matched controls . METHODS : Patients and controls received VLED treatment ( 640 kcal/day ) during 12 16 weeks depending on baseline ( BL ) BMI < 40 or >/= 40 kg/m , followed by an energy restricted diet . Serum was collected at BL and M6 , and biomarkers were measured with Magnetic Luminex ( ( R ) ) Assays and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Nonparametric statistics and paired comparison tests were used . RESULTS : In the PsA patients , the following proteins were significantly reduced at M6 as compared to BL : hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) ( median ( first third quartile ) 9 ( 3 6 ) pg/mL vs . 3 ( 9 0 ) pg/mL , p < 01 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) ( 6 ( 9 5 ) pg/mL vs . 6 ( 1 3 ) pg/mL , p = 01 ) , B cell activating factor ( BAFF ) ( 4 ( 4 3 ) pg/mL vs . 6 ( 2 5 ) pg/mL , p = 01 ) and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein ( COMP ) ( 1 ( 9 0 ) ng/mL vs . 0 ( 0 0 ) ng/mL , p < 01 ) , whereas carboxyterminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen ( CTX 1 ) was significantly increased ( 0 ( 0 5 ) pg/mL vs . 0 ( 0 0 ) pg/mL , p < 01 ) . Similar results were found in the control group . CONCLUSIONS : Weight loss was associated with reduced levels of serum biomarkers related to inflammation and cartilage degradation , and increased biomarkers for bone resorption . The study supports the strong relationship between obesity , inflammation , bone and cartilage metabolism , identifying BMI as a possible confounder for biomarker levels .

BACKGROUND : Hyperoxaluria , characterized by excessive oxalate production , can be attributed to high dietary oxalate intake , genetic disorders affecting oxalate metabolism , or certain intestinal diseases . Despite its clinical significance , there is a paucity of comprehensive discussions regarding the reference interval ( RI ) for oxalate levels in spot urine samples . This study aims to establish an appropriate adult RI for oxalate in spot urine to enhance the interpretation of clinical data . METHODS : Between January 2021 and July 2021 , a cohort of 608 adults aged 19 to 85 years undergoing routine physical examinations was recruited to establish the RI . Additionally , 381 adults with complete datasets were analyzed to examine variables influencing the urinary oxalate/urinary creatinine ( UOA/UCr ) ratio . Urinary oxalate levels were quantified using a high performance liquid chromatography assay assured by a proficiency testing from the College of American Pathologists . RESULTS : The study established sex and age specific Ris for the UOA/UCr ratio . For males , three age specific partitions were identified : 19 29 years ( 499 39 mmol/mol ) , 30 39 years ( 25 29 mmol/mol ) , and >/= 40 years ( 13 69 mmol/mol ) . In contrast , for females , two age specific partitions were required : 19 39 years ( 03 93 mmol/mol ) and >/= 40 years ( 00 84 mmol/mol ) . UALB/UCr and UREA were recognized as key confounding factors in linear regression that could account for the differences in the UOA/UCr ratio in people . CONCLUSION : Determining adult RI of oxalate in spot urine is crucial for diagnosing hyperoxaluria . Our sex and age specific reference intervals will be beneficial for hyperoxaluria screening . The findings regarding the relationship between variables support explaining the variation of UOA/UCr ratio in individuals .
BACKGROUND : The insect gut microbiota forms a complex , multifunctional system that significantly affects phenotypic traits linked to environmental adaptation . Strong reproductive potential underpins the migratory success , population growth and destructive impact of the fall armyworm , Spodoptera frugiperda ( J . E . Smith ) . However , the precise role of gut bacteria in S . frugiperda reproductive processes , distribution and transmission dynamics remains unclear . RESULTS : We examined the gut microbiota of S . frugiperda a major invasive agricultural pest , identifying Enterococcus , Enterobacter , and Klebsiella as core microorganisms present throughout its life cycle . These microbes showed heightened activity during the egg stage , early larval stages and pre oviposition period in females . Using an axenic insect re infection system , Enterococcus quebecensis FAW181 , Klebsiella michiganensis FAW071 and Enterobacter hormaechei FAW049 were found to significantly enhance host fecundity , increasing egg production by 73% , 95% , and 71% , respectively . Metagenomic and haemolymph metabolomic analyses revealed a positive correlation between gut symbiotic bacteria and hormone metabolism in female S . frugiperda . Further analysis of metabolites in the insect hormone biosynthesis pathway , along with exogenous injection of juvenile hormone III and 20 hydroxyecdysone , revealed that gut microbes regulate these hormones , maintaining levels equivalent to those in control insects . This regulation supports improved fecundity in S . frugiperda , aiding rapid colonization and population expansion . CONCLUSIONS : These findings emphasize the pivotal role of gut bacteria E . quebecensis FAW181 , E . hormaechei FAW049 , and K . michiganensis FAW071 in enhancing S . frugiperda reproduction by modulating JH III levels through JHAMT regulation and concurrently modulating the levels of 20E and its precursors via PHM . Our results provide novel insights into microbe host symbiosis and pest management strategies for alien invasive species . Video Abstract .
Neurodegenerative diseases are a class of conditions with widespread detrimental impacts , currently lacking effective therapeutic drugs . Recent studies have identified mitochondrial dysfunction and the resultant oxidative stress as crucial contributors to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases . Polyphenols , naturally occurring compounds with inherent antioxidant properties , have demonstrated the potential to target mitochondria and mitigate oxidative stress . This therapeutic potential has garnered significant attention in recent years . Investigating the mitochondrial targeting capacity of polyphenols , their role in functional regulation , and their ability to modulate oxidative stress , along with exploring novel technologies and strategies for modifying polyphenol compounds and their formulations , holds promise for providing new avenues for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases .
BACKGROUND : Multiple effects of ultrafine particles ( UFP ) on human subjects are known but there is less knowledge of how relative exposure levels between ultrafine and fine particles as typically encountered in large cities affect lung function and cardiovascular parameters . METHODS : Four sites with high/low levels of ultrafine particles and/or fine particles were selected in the city of Munich , Germany : control area ( woodland ) , urban environment , heavy traffic site , biomass combustion ( beech wood ) . In a randomized cross over design , 26 young , healthy individuals were exposed at each site over 75 min to atmospheric pollutants , which were monitored continuously , while performing intermittent ( 5 min per 15 min ) light exercise . Parameters assessed pre and post exposure comprised symptoms , spirometry , lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) and nitric oxide ( DLNO ) , alveolar volume ( AV ) , the fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide ( FeNO ) , reactive hyperemia index ( RHI ) , blood pressure , and heart rate . Outcomes were expressed as percent changes of parameters and analyses performed by either comparing the four sites or by multiple linear regression analyses using the measured pollutant levels . RESULTS : The sites showed the planned pattern of exposure levels but with large overlap . Outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between sites , except for symptoms which were elevated with heavy traffic site exposure and biomass combustion . In regression analyses , AV decreased by 92 ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 28 to 57 ) % per 10 , 000/cm UFP ; similarly , for LDSA ( lung deposited surface area ) , which was highly correlated with UFP . Overall , FeNO slightly increased after exposure , but this increase was attenuated by 4 ( 95% CI : 8 to 2 ) % per 10 ppb ambient NO . Heart rate decreased after exposures overall ; this decrease was enhanced by 1 ( 95% CI : 3 to 0 ) % per 10 , 000/cm UFP . CONCLUSIONS : Short term exposures to UFP elicited a reduction in the lung volume ( AV ) accessible to gas transport by diffusion and convection . FeNO was slightly elevated after all exposures , but this increase was significantly smaller at higher ambient NO concentrations . While these effects were too small to be clinically relevant , they demonstrated that typical levels of urban air pollution had measurable acute effects in young , healthy individuals .
BACKGROUND : Muscle derived uric acid ( UA ) precursors combined with fructose ingestion may increase liver UA production . Temporary hyperuricemia could impact metabolic and physiological responses over a 24 h period . This study examined the effects of intensive resistance exercise ( RE ) combined with excessive fructose intake on metabolic and physiological responses . METHODS : Twelve healthy young males participated in four trials : RE with fructose intake ( EF ) , RE with water intake ( EW ) , control ( no exercise ) with fructose intake ( CF ) , and control with water intake ( CW ) . Blood UA , glucose , lipids , blood pressure , and markers of kidney and liver function were measured during fasting and at 0 , 5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , and 24 h before and after exercise . RESULTS : UA levels in the EF and EW trials were significantly higher than those in the CF and CW trials at all post exercise time points . The next morning , UA levels in the EF trial remained above 7 mg/dL . Increased glucose levels at 0 and 5 h post exercise and increased creatinine ( CRE ) levels immediately post exercise were observed . RE reduced the area under the curve for the estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) and increased systolic blood pressure , mean arterial blood pressure , and the UA/CRE ratio the next morning . Fructose intake increased glutamate pyruvate transaminase ( GPT ) levels 24 h post exercise . CRE showed a positive correlation with UA levels , while eGFR was negatively correlated with UA levels in the RE trials . Additionally , GPT levels correlated positively with UA following fructose intake . CONCLUSION : Intensive RE combined with excessive fructose intake induced a notable increase in UA levels . This increase in UA levels appeared to be associated with temporary fluctuations in markers related to renal function .
BACKGROUND : Higher embryonic mortality , especially in aged breeding hens , is associated with insufficient hepatic functionality in maintaining redox homeostasis . Our previous study demonstrated that egg exosome derived miRNAs may play a key role in modulating embryonic oxidation reduction process , whereas the exact function and mechanism were still poorly understood . The present study aimed to investigate the roles of egg exosome miRNAs in maintaining dynamic equilibrium of free radicals and peroxide agents in embryonic liver , as well as demonstrate the specific mechanism using oxidative stress challenged hepatocytes . RESULTS : Compared to 36 week old breeding hens , decreased hatchability and increased embryonic mortality were observed in 65 week old breeding hens . Meanwhile , the older group showed the increased MDA levels and decreased SOD and GSH Px activities in embryonic liver , muscle and serum . Embryonic mortality was significantly positively correlated with MDA level and negatively correlated with GSH Px activity in embryonic liver . In addition , 363 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) were identified in embryonic liver , 13 differentially expressed miRNAs ( DE miRNAs ) were identified in egg exosomes . These DEGs and DE miRNAs were involved in oxidoreductase activity , glutathione metabolic process , MAPK signaling pathway , apoptosis and autophagy . miRNA mRNA network analysis further found that DEGs targeted by DE miRNAs were mainly enriched in programmed cell death , such as apoptosis and autophagy . Wherein , MAPK10 with highest MCC and AUC values was significantly related to GSH Px activity and MDA level , and served as the target gene of miR 145 5p based on dual luciferase reporter experiment and correlation analysis . Bioinformatics analysis found that miR 145 5p/MAPK10 axis might alleviate peroxide generation and apoptosis . In primary hepatocytes of chick embryos , miR 145 5p transfection significantly reversed HO induced mitochondrial ROS increase , MAPK10 , BAX and CASP3 overexpression and excessive apoptosis . CONCLUSION : Exosome miR 145 5p in eggs could target MAPK10 and decrease mitochondrial ROS , attenuating oxidative damage and apoptosis in hepatocytes of chick embryos . These findings may provide new theoretical basis for the improvement of maternal physiological status to maintain embryonic redox homeostasis by nutritional or genetic modifications .
BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Previous study found that interleukin 1beta ( IL 1beta ) is associated with diabetic cognitive dysfunction . Heat shock protein 27 ( HSP27 ) is one of the factors related to IL 1beta associated inflammation . Here , we aim to investigate the role of HSP27 in mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS : In this study , individuals with T2DM with and without MCI were recruited and categorized into Control and MCI groups . Plasma HSP27 levels were assessed and compared between the Control and MCI groups . Furthermore , the relationship between HSP27 and diabetic dysfunction was elucidated through association and regression analyses . Finally , diagnostic values were determined using ROC curves . RESULTS : In humans , individuals with T2DM and MCI exhibit decreased levels of HSP27 compared to those without MCI . Notably , the levels of HSP27 are associated with neuropsychological test scores that reflect cognitive preferences . Additionally , decreased HSP27 levels serve as one of the risk factors for MCI in T2DM patients ( OR = 355 , P = 002 ) . Moreover , there is a defined cut off point for HSP27 in diagnosing MCI , set at 51 pg/ml , with a sensitivity of 2% , a specificity of 4% , and an area under the curve ( AUC ) of CONCLUSIONS : Generally speaking , HSP27 is linked to cognitive decline in individuals with T2DM . Decreased levels of HSP27 in plasma are identified as both a risk factor for MCI and a potential diagnostic biomarker for MCI in patients with T2DM . The diagnostic value of HSP27 in MCI is primarily reflected in its demonstrated true negative rate .
BACKGROUND : Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult to treat neoplasias . Because of that , the prognosis of the disease is dismal , and identification of novel therapeutic approaches is needed . This study investigates the role of transforming growth factor alpha ( TGFalpha ) in pancreatic cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target . METHODS : Using in silico platforms , it was confirmed that TGFA , the gene encoding TGFalpha , is significantly overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinomas relative to normal pancreatic tissues . In patient derived xenografts as well as in pancreatic cancer cell lines , multiple molecular forms of TGFalpha were identified , including the transmembrane TGFalpha precursor ( proTGFalpha ) and the soluble 6 kDa mature form . Functional assays using RNA interference and CRISPR/Cas9 demonstrated that TGFA knockdown significantly impaired cell proliferation , reinforcing the critical role of TGFalpha in driving tumor growth . The therapeutic potential of targeting TGFalpha was evaluated through the development of two monoclonal antibodies ( 5F1 and 16B10 ) specific for TGFalpha . RESULTS : These antibodies effectively bound to proTGFalpha expressing cells , with minimal off target effects in TGFA knockout cell lines . When conjugated to cytotoxic agents such as MMAF , the resulting antibody drug conjugates ( ADCs ) exhibited potent antiproliferative activity , significantly reducing the viability of TGFalpha expressing pancreatic cancer cells . Mechanistic studies revealed that MMAF loaded ADCs induced G2/M cell cycle arrest , with markers of mitotic disruption evident in treated cells . In vivo , the TGFalpha targeting ADCs elicited substantial tumor regression in murine models of pancreatic cancer , whereas the unconjugated antibodies merely stabilized tumor growth . CONCLUSIONS : These findings highlight TGFalpha as a promising therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer , supporting further preclinical and clinical development of TGFalpha directed ADCs .
Neuroinflammation plays a complex and context dependent role in many neurodegenerative diseases . We identified a key pathogenic function of macrophages in a mouse model of a rare human congenital neuropathy in which SARM1 , the central executioner of axon degeneration , is activated by hypomorphic mutations in the axon survival factor NMNAT Macrophage depletion blocked and reversed neuropathic phenotypes in this sarmopathy model , revealing SARM1 dependent neuroimmune mechanisms as key drivers of disease pathogenesis . In this study , we investigated the impact of chronic subacute SARM1 activation on the peripheral nerve milieu using single cell/nucleus RNA sequencing ( sc/snRNA seq ) . Our analyses reveal an expansion of immune cells ( macrophages and T lymphocytes ) and repair Schwann cells , as well as significant transcriptional alterations to a wide range of nerve resident cell types . Notably , endoneurial fibroblasts show increased expression of chemokines ( Ccl9 , Cxcl5 ) and complement components ( C3 , C4b , C6 ) in response to chronic SARM1 activation , indicating enhanced immune cell recruitment and immune response regulation by non immune nerve resident cells . Analysis of CD45 ( + ) immune cells in sciatic nerves revealed an expansion of an Il1b ( + ) macrophage subpopulation with increased expression of markers associated with phagocytosis and T cell activation/proliferation . We also found a significant increase in T cells in sarmopathic nerves . Remarkably , T cell depletion rescued motor phenotypes in the sarmopathy model . These findings delineate the significant changes chronic SARM1 activation induces in peripheral nerves and highlights the potential of immunomodulatory therapies for SARM1 dependent peripheral neurodegenerative disease .
BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES : Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) infection was scarcely reported as a prejudicing factor of CLP incidence . The aim of this study is to report an association between HCMV infection and incidence of severe orofacial clefts . MATERIALS/METHODS : Five infants with severe orofacial clefts were included in the current study . One of the infants is with an oblique facial cleft extended to the left orbit and associated with missing left eyeball . Another infant was with facial cleft extending downward resulting in a clefted lower lip , clefted mandible and clefted tongue . All the patients ' mothers were evaluated for the amount of HCMV IgG in blood samples . RESULTS : All the five mothers of the included infants had a positive HCMV IgG results in the collected blood samples with the value of 8 ( +/ 6 ) . The amount of HCMV IgG was higher in cases with more severe clinical presentation . LIMITATIONS : Due to the rarity of cases with severe orofacial clefts , only 5 patients were included . Lake of genetic data and control group are another limitations . CONCLUSION : Within the limitation of the rareness of cases with severe orofacial clefts , HCMV infection to mothers before or during pregnancy might be a predisposing factor of incidence of severe orofacial clefts .
Epigenetic regulation , including DNA methylation and histone modifications , play a pivotal role in shaping T cell functionality throughout life . With aging , these epigenetic changes profoundly affect gene expression , altering T cell plasticity , activation , and differentiation . These modifications contribute significantly to immunosenescence , increasing susceptibility to infections , cancer , and autoimmune diseases . In CD8 ( + ) T cells , chromatin closure at key regulatory regions suppresses activation and migration , while chromatin opening in pro inflammatory gene loci amplifies inflammation . These changes drive terminal differentiation , characterized by increased expression of senescence associated markers , impaired migration and loss of epigenetic plasticity . CD4 ( + ) T cells experience fewer but critical epigenetic alterations , including disrupted pathways , a skewed Th1/Th2 balance , and reduced Treg functionality . These epigenetic changes , compounded by metabolic dysfunctions , such as mitochondrial deficiency and oxidative stress , impair T cell adaptability and resilience in the aging organism . Therefore , understanding the interplay between epigenetic and metabolic factors in T cell aging offers promising therapeutic opportunities to mitigate immunosenescence and enhance immune function in aging populations . This review explores the interplay between DNA methylation , histone alterations , and metabolic changes underlying T cell aging .
OBJECTIVE : This study was designed to evaluate the effects of Semaglutide and adenosine on kidney protein expression in obese mice induced by a high fat diet ( HFD ) , to identify signaling pathways involved in the obesity related glomerulonephropathy ( ORG ) regulation using a proteomics approach . MATERIALS AND METHODS : A total of 48 mice were divided into normal fat diet ( NFD ) , high fat diet ( HFD ) , HFD + semaglutide intervention ( HS ) , and HFD + adenosine intervention ( HA ) groups . Mouse serum , urine , and kidney tissue samples were collected to identify markers for blood glucose lipid metabolism , inflammation , oxidative stress ( OS ) , kidney damage protein , urinary protein/creatinine , and other relevant factors . The kidney pathological changes of mice were observed under light and electron microscope . The differences in total proteins in the kidneys of mice were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC MS/MS ) . The proteins with significant differences were selected for bioinformatics and Western Blot ( WB ) analyses . RESULTS : Semaglutide and adenosine can reduce the weight of obese mice , improve the level of glucose and lipid metabolism , inflammation , and OS in obese mice , and have a positive effect on glomerular and tubular lesions in mice . The TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway , which is involved in the pathogenesis of murine ORG , was screened using a proteomics approach . Western Blot showed that the expressions of Txn , Txnip , and NLRP3 in HFD mice were significantly higher than those of NFD mice , while the expression levels of Txn , Txnip , and NLRP3 in HS and HA mice were substantially lower than those of HFD mice . CONCLUSION : Semaglutide and adenosine can ameliorate obesity induced renal injury , potentially through modulation of the Txnip/NLRP3 pathway .
BACKGROUND : The incidence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases ( CMD ) continues to rise among middle aged and elderly populations , affecting not only physical health but also significantly increasing the risk of depression . This study aims to construct a machine learning model to predict the risk of depression in middle aged and elderly patients with CMD and to identssify key risk factors . METHODS : Based on data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study ( CHARLS ) from 2018 to 2020 , 4 , 477 patients aged 45 and above were included . LASSO regression was used to screen for risk factors , and three machine learning algorithms logistic regression ( LR ) , random forest ( RF ) , and XGBoost were employed to build predictive models . The performance of the models was evaluated using ROC curves , calibration curves , and decision curves . RESULTS : The study found several risk factors significantly associated with depression , including disability status , pain , retirement status , number of chronic diseases , education level , age , gender , place of residence , life satisfaction , optimism about the future , and self rated health status . The incidence of depression was significantly higher among women ( 56% ) , rural residents ( 64% ) , individuals with disabilities , non retirees ( 85% ) , and those with chronic illnesses ( 73% ) . The LR model demonstrated the best predictive performance , with an AUC of Key predictive factors included self rated health , residence , education level , gender , pain , life satisfaction , age , and hope for the future . CONCLUSION : This study developed a depression risk prediction model based on logistic regression , providing important references for psychological health interventions in middle aged and elderly patients with CMD . Identifying and intervening in high risk populations is crucial for improving patients ' quality of life .
BACKGROUND : Esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) is the sixth most deadly cancer worldwide , with increasing incidence in North America . As no targeted therapy or immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of EAC , chemotherapy is the only standard of care . Most patients with EAC experience poor outcomes because of the inherent or acquired resistance to chemotherapy . METHODS : Adapting a patient centered approach , we leveraged a microfluidic cell culture technology platform ( Emulate ) , organoids derived from treatment naive patient tumors or adjacent normal tissues , and patient matched cancer associated or normal fibroblasts respectively , to develop a novel , physiologically relevant , high fidelity preclinical esophagus on a chip model . H&E , immunofluorescence staining , live/dead assay , LDH assay , and ELISA based detection of tumor biomarkers were used to assess treatment responses . RESULTS : Each patient specific stroma inclusive microfluidic esophageal adenocarcinoma on a chip ( EAC chip ) faithfully recreates the tumor stroma interface while preserving the full diversity of two cell types ( epithelia and fibroblasts ) , genetic landscapes and histological architecture of the source tumors . EAC chips also accurately predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT ) within a clinically useful timeframe ( approx . 12 days ) . A docetaxel based triplet chemotherapy regimen matched with the treatment of the source patient was successfully perfused through the interstitial space within this model . Therefore , EAC chips more accurately recapitulate inpatient pathological and objective responses than the corresponding static 3D organoid only cultures . CONCLUSIONS : Overall , this model is an effective tool for predicting patients ' responses to chemotherapy and testing tumor or stroma targeted alternative therapies . Moreover , these high fidelity , low throughput EAC chips effectively complement high throughput PDO culture based drug testing and provide improved insights into drug efficacy before human studies .
BACKGROUND : Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease ( MASLD ) , which was formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) has become a global epidemic that is predicted to affect more than 50% of the world population by However , except for Resmetiron , there are no approved drugs in conventional medicine to treat MASLD . The aim of this study was to explore the hepatoprotective effects of the aqueous extracts ( AEs ) of Osbeckia octandra ( O . octandra ) , Vernonia cinerea ( V . cinerea ) , and Atalantia ceylanica ( A . ceylanica ) which have been extensively used to treat hepatic diseases in the Sri Lankan traditional medicine . METHODS : During initial in vitro experiments , aqueous extracts ( AEs ) of these three medicinal plants were prepared and evaluated for antioxidant potential using 2 , 2 diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH ) assay and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity ( TEAC ) assay . Cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT assay on Vero cells to determine non toxic doses for in vivo studies . For in vivo experiments , a high fat diet ( HFD ) induced MASLD mouse model was used . After co treating the mice with AEs of the tested medicinal plants , their body weight gain was evaluated . Serum ALT , cholesterol , and triglyceride levels were analyzed using standard chemical methods . Hepatic lipid aggregation was evaluated by histopathology . Expression of TNF alpha , IL 6 , and PPAR alpha genes was quantified using qRT PCR . Data were analyzed using one way ANOVA followed by Tukey ' s post hoc test or LSD test . The level of significance was ( p < 05 ) . RESULTS : Initial in vitro experiments revealed that AEs of these medicinal plants are rich sources of natural antioxidants with low cytotoxic effects . Subsequent in vivo experiments on the HFD induced MASLD mouse model also demonstrated that AEs of these medicinal plants can ameliorate HFD induced weight gain , dyslipidemia , and hepatic lipid aggregation . Reversal of downregulated PPAR alpha gene expression confirmed their positive impact on lipid metabolism . Attenuation of increased serum ALT concentration provides evidence for their protective role against hepatic injury . In addition , these extracts could suppress the upregulation of TNF alpha and IL 6 genes , which are crucial for inducing steatohepatitis . CONCLUSION : Aqueous extracts of O . octandra , V . cinerea , and A . ceylanica are rich in antioxidants and have the ability to suppress HFD induced weight gain , dyslipidemias , hepatic steatosis , and hepatic inflammation providing solid evidence for their beneficial effects against initiation and progression of MASLD . Among these extracts , O . octandra stands out with the highest antioxidant activity , lowest cytotoxicity , and most promising hepatoprotective effects .
The transcriptome profiling for underpinning the role of key genes controlling formation of fiber in cultivated Gossypium barbadense compared to wild allotetraploid cotton Gossypium darwinii which remained less investigated . Owing to excellent fiber quality of both Gossypium barbadense and Gossypium darwinii and information obtained via Simple Sequence Repeat ( SSR ) markers , two lines : Xh 18 and darwinii 5 7 were selected for transcriptome sequencing during developmental stages i . e . , fiber initiation , elongation , and secondary cell wall ( SCW ) biosynthesis followed by 0 day after anthesis ( DPA ) , 5DPA , 10DPA , 15DPA and 25DPA , respectively . Twelve libraries of RNA seq were generated and sequenced individually generating approximately 818 million clean reads of Gossypium darwinii . However , for Gossypium barbadense more than 844 million clean reads were recorded . The Pearson Correlation Coefficient ( PCC ) analysis results indicated that gene expressions for both Gossypium barbadense and Gossypium darwinii indicated more than 90% of the commonalities at the same stage of fiber growth . However , genes found among Gossypium darwinii at 5 , 6 and 7 DPA and XH 18 at 10 and 25 DPA were found disimilar . The expression quantity of RNA sequencing data , 31 genes were found common throughout all stages of DPAs in Gossypium darwinii 5 7 whereas , 377 genes were common in Gossypium barbadense XH 18 at 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25 DPA stages of fiber development . Three genes XLOC_080616 ( LTPG2_ARATH/ NLTL2_ARATH ; GPI anchored 2 non specific lipid transfer protein , similar to At2 g13820 ) , XLOC_065471 ( LPAT2_ARATH/LPAT2_BRAOL 1 acyl sn glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase2 ) , and XLOC_077416 ( uncharacterized protein ) shown up regulated expression during 15 and 20 DPA for both Gossypium barbadense and Gossypium darwinii . It will also explore the possible role Gossypium barbadense DNA segment associated with development of fiber quality . Furthermore , this research will decipher the underlying process of fiber development and the possible role of genes for fiber formation in both Sea Island and wild cotton species .
BACKGROUND : Saffron , the dried stigma of the flower Crocus sativus L . , has been shown to have therapeutic effects on cardiovascular diseases . Several studies have explored the impact of saffron on atherosclerosis . However , the mechanism underlying the plaque stabilizing and antiatherosclerotic effects of saffron has not been widely studied . Therefore , this study aimed to investigate the mechanism of the antiatherosclerotic and plaque stabilizing effects of saffron ethanolic extract in experimentally induced atherosclerotic rabbits . METHODS : New Zealand White rabbits were fed a 1% high cholesterol diet ( HCD ) for 8 weeks to induce established atherosclerosis . The rabbits were then treated with 50 or 100 mg/kg/day saffron ethanolic extract ( SAF ) , simvastatin ( 5 mg/kg/day ) or placebo for another 8 weeks . Body weight , lipid profile , percentage of atherosclerotic lesions , immunohistochemical analysis , and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction were performed at baseline , after high cholesterol diet feeding , and after the intervention . RESULTS : The results showed that SAF had no significant effect on body weight . However , treatment with both doses of SAF markedly attenuated the levels of low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and total cholesterol ( TC ) in atherosclerotic rabbits . Higher doses of SAF markedly reduced atherosclerotic lesions in rabbit aortas . Additionally , SAF suppressed the tissue and gene expression of adhesion molecules and pro inflammatory biomarkers in the aorta . SAF also reduced MMP 9 tissue expression in the aortas of atherosclerotic rabbits , thereby increasing plaque stability . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings suggest that saffron ethanolic extract exhibits therapeutic potential in rabbits with HCD induced atherosclerosis . This effect may be associated with the modulation of inflammatory pathways , leading to reduced expression of pro inflammatory cytokines , endothelial activation markers , and matrix metalloproteinases . The observed reduction in vascular inflammation and endothelial activation may contribute to improved lipid profiles , decreased atherosclerotic lesion severity , and enhanced plaque stability . While these findings highlight the potential of saffron ethanolic extract as an adjunctive treatment for atherosclerosis , further studies are warranted to clarify its direct effects on lipid metabolism and underlying molecular mechanisms . CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER : Not applicable .
BACKGROUND : Alcohol consumption is linked to varied health outcomes . While alcohol appears to have a protective effect on renal function , the impact on patients with diabetes mellitus ( DM ) and hypertension ( HTN ) remains unclear . This cross sectional observational study aims to explore the association between alcohol use and renal function , particularly for individuals with these comorbidities . METHODS : Data from participants in the Taiwan Biobank were analyzed . Participants were divided into drinkers and non drinkers . Drinkers were defined as an alcohol intake of 150 mL or more per week for at least six months . Renal function was assessed using creatinine levels and 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration ( CKD EPI ) creatinine for estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) . Multivariate multiple regression models were used to examine the relationships between alcohol consumption , DM , HTN , and renal function . RESULTS : Drinkers had better renal function than non drinkers , with higher eGFR values and lower creatinine levels . Alcohol consumption was linked to better renal function in DM patients but not HTN patients . A three way interaction ( drinking/DM/HTN ) also revealed improved renal function . CONCLUSIONS : This study suggests that alcohol consumption may be associated with better renal function outcomes , particularly in patients with DM and HTN . However , these findings should be interpreted cautiously given the cross sectional nature of the study . Further longitudinal and mechanistic research is warranted to validate the findings . CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER : Not applicable .

This study evaluates the protective efficacy of six novel mRNA vaccine candidates against these variants using a golden hamster model . METHODS : Six mRNA vaccines were designed , targeting the spike ( S ) and nucleocapsid ( N ) proteins of SARS CoV The vaccines were tested on golden hamsters , which were immunized and then challenged with Delta , Omicron BA . 5 , and XBB EG . 5 variants . Key outcomes measured included body weight , viral RNA loads in various tissues , cytokine levels , and lung tissue pathology . RESULTS : Hamsters vaccinated with the novel mRNA vaccines showed reduced weight loss , lower viral RNA loads in throat swabs and lung tissues , and reduced levels of pro inflammatory cytokines compared to control groups . Additionally , vaccinated animals exhibited significantly less lung damage as evidenced by both histological and immunofluorescence analyses , especially in groups vaccinated with RBD Fe , RE N , and COVID 19 epitope formulations . CONCLUSIONS : These mRNA vaccines demonstrated broad protective efficacy against multiple SARS CoV 2 variants . They elicited immune responses , reduced viral RNA loads , and mitigated inflammatory and pathological damage , highlighting their potential in combating rapidly evolving SARS CoV 2 variants .
BACKGROUND : Although many effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ( AMF ) on host plants have been well documented , whether the effects of AMF on parental generations could affect offspring performance is not fully clear . We tested whether effects of AMF on current generation of host plants would transgenerationally impact on the offspring under different phosphorus ( P ) soil conditions by two experiments . METHODOLOGY : The first experiment was continued for 4 consecutive years to determine whether AMF affect host plants adaptation to a low P environment . The experiment had four treatments : low P soil without AMF ( NM LP ) , low P soil with AMF ( M LP ) , high P soil without AMF ( NM HP ) , and high P soil with AMF ( M HP ) . The second experiment was to determine the effects of AMF status of parental plants on offspring ( seeds of third filial generation from the first experiment , F3 seeds ) in four P levels ( 0 , 9 , 18 , and 36 mg kg ( 1 ) ) in agar without AMF . RESULTS : In the first experiment , M LP host plants had earlier flowering time than NM LP host plants in both parental plants and F Shoot biomass ( P = 013 ) , root biomass ( P = 001 ) , ratio of root biomass to shoot biomass ( P < 001 ) and seed P concentration ( P = 001 ) of M LP host plants were higher than NM LP host plants in F In second experiment , lateral root length and the ratio of lateral root length to main root length were highest for M LP seedlings across all P levels for F3 seeds ( P < 05 ) . With P levels of 0 and 9 mg kg ( 1 ) , average root diameter was higher for M HP seedlings than M LP seedlings for F3 seeds ( 0 mg kg ( 1 ) : P = 007 , 9 mg kg ( 1 ) : P = 027 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Our results show that AMF not only influences the current generation of host plants , but also greatly affects their offspring especially when their parents have grown under low P soil condition .
BACKGROUND : tRNA derived fragments ( tRFs ) have emerged as significant noncoding RNAs in cancer biology ; however , their roles and mechanisms in triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) remain inadequately characterized . METHODS : tRF and tiRNA sequencing , real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT qPCR ) , fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) , and subcellular fractionation were used to explore the expression and characteristic of tiRNA Met in TNBC . The biological functions of tiRNA Met were assessed using CCK 8 assays , colony formation assays , and Transwell assays in vitro , alongside mouse xenograft models in vivo . RNA pull down , mass spectrum , RNA immunoprecipitation ( RIP ) , western blot , ubiquitination assays , RNA sequencing , actinomycin D assays , immunofluorescence , immunohistochemical staining , and rescue experiments were performed to explore the regulatory mechanisms of tiRNA Met in TNBC . RESULTS : tiRNA Met was an uncharacterized tRF that originated from mitochondrial tRNA ( Met CAT ) and was primarily localized in the cytoplasm . Its expression was significantly downregulated in TNBC tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues . Overexpression of tiRNA Met markedly inhibited the proliferation , migration , and invasion of TNBC cells ; whereas , its reduced expression elicited opposite effects . In addition , tiRNA Met overexpression suppressed TNBC cell growth in vivo . Mechanistically , tiRNA Met directly interacted with the RNA recognition motif 2 ( RRM2 ) domain of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein A ( SNRPA ) , promoting SNRPA protein degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway . This interaction enhanced the stability of Ran binding protein 3 like ( RANBP3L ) mRNA , resulting in increased RANBP3L expression and subsequent inhibition of the mTORC1/RPS6 signaling pathway . CONCLUSIONS : Our study identified tiRNA Met as a novel anti oncogenic tRF and elucidated its mechanism for inhibiting the malignancy of TNBC . tiRNA Met directly bound to SNRPA , promoting its degradation and stabilizing RANBP3L mRNA , ultimately leading to the inhibition of the mTORC1 signaling pathway . These findings position tiRNA Met as a promising candidate for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in TNBC .
The proper distribution of nutrients and metabolites between the mother and fetus is one important factor for successful pregnancy . As a bridge , the placenta plays a key role in sensing the nutritional needs of the fetus , coordinating the maternal nutrition supply , and enhancing its nutritional transport capabilities . Imperfect placental development can lead to pregnancy related disorders such as preeclampsia , recurrent miscarriage , and/or fetal growth restriction , posing risks to both mother and child in the short and long term . However , current understanding of the human placenta remains as a " black box " , and its developmental control mechanisms for adaptive pregnant regulation still needs to be elucidated . As one form of post translational modification ( PTM ) , ubiquitination plays an important role in regulating cellular functions and is regarded as a valuable drug target . Particularly , ubiquitination related to placenta development has been discovered in recent years . Placental development processes closely associated with pregnant complications , such as blastocyst implantation , syncytiotrophoblast cell differentiation , and immune barrier maintenance , have been reported to be affected by ubiquitination . However , the diagnosis and intervention of pregnancy diseases also urgently need to be improved . Thus , aiming to comprehensive summarize and further exploring the molecular mechanism , target and regulatory mechanism of pregnancy complications , we have herein reviewed genes and pathways regulating pregnancy progress and diseases and focusing on ubiquitin related physiological process in placenta .
BACKGROUND : Nowadays , climate change has intensified environmental stresses , including salinity and drought stress . Salinity and drought significantly impair crop growth and yield by affecting physiological and biochemical processes . One of the ways to enhance environmental stress tolerance in plants is to improve their symbiotic relationships with soil microorganisms . This study investigates the impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ( AMF ) and Trichoderma harzianum ( accession number : PV544806 ) inoculation on maize to trace the activated pathways under stress conditions . Maize plants were exposed to different stress conditions : salinity ( S1D0 ) , drought ( S0D1 ) , and a combination of both salinity and drought ( S1D1 ) . They received treatments with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ( AMF ) ( M1T0 ) , Trichoderma ( M0T1 ) , and a combination of both ( M1T1 ) . RESULTS : Inoculation of maize plants with AMF and T . harzianum markedly enhanced root dry weight , root volume , and total biomass under stress conditions . Additionally , the simultaneous inoculation of AMF and T . harzianum under combined salinity and drought conditions significantly affected traits such as dry weight of aerial parts , total biomass , and root colonization percentage compared to the non inoculated control . Physiologically , the results also indicated that the inoculation significantly increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes SOD and APX . Results from GC MS analysis and metabolic pathway analysis showed that the combined inoculation of AMF and Trichoderma in maize plants stimulated the production of specific secondary metabolites such as oxaloacetate , Delta1 piperidine 6 carboxylate , and cadaverine under stress conditions . CONCLUSIONS : Based on this study ' s findings , the use of AMF and T . harzianum can enhance maize growth and performance under salinity and drought stress by stimulating the production of secondary metabolites .
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the impact of social distancing measures due to COVID 19 pandemic on glycemic and blood pressure control in primary care in Hong Kong . METHODS : This was a retrospective cross sectional study . Diabetic patients with regular follow up in 8 public primary care clinics in Hong Kong within the study period were recruited . The outcomes were to detect any difference of HbA1c levels and BP between pre pandemic group ( 2019 group ) and the 1 year post pandemic group ( 2020 group ) in all patients and in sub group analysis of different age groups , sex , body mass index , presence of diabetic complications and different diabetic treatment . RESULTS : There was no statistically significant change in HbA1c level between 2020 and 2019 groups which was 019% ( 95% confidence interval [CI] 057% to 094% , p = 632 ) . There was also no statistically significant change in both systolic and diastolic BP between 2020 and 2019 groups which were 143 mmHg ( 95%CI 005 mmHg to 719 mmHg , p = 745 ) and 148 mmHg ( 95%CI 422 mmHg to 718 mmHg , p = 611 ) . Subgroup analysis showed that female gender had statistically significant improvement in glycaemic control ( HbA1c 92% in 2020 group versus HbA1c 03% in 2019 group , p = 021 ) . Patients with diabetic retinopathy had statistically significant lower diastolic BP ( diastolic BP 73 mmHg in 2020 group versus diastolic BP 75 mmHg in 2019 group with p = 011 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Despite the implementation of various social distancing measures resulting in significant change in lifestyle , COVID 19 pandemic did not worsen glycaemic and blood pressure control in T2DM patients . In fact , slight improvement in glycaemic control among female patients was found . TRIAL REGISTRATION : Not applicable .
BACKGROUND : Inter alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 ( ITIH4 ) , a Type 2 acute phase protein , is critical for resolving inflammation and promoting tissue repair . While its role in chronic respiratory diseases is recognized , its effects on asthma remain unclear . This study investigated the effects of ITIH4 on the modulation of lung and gut microbiota , the attenuation of allergic inflammation , and the improvement of respiratory outcomes in an asthma mouse model . METHODS : Six week old male Balb/c mice were divided into five groups : control , ITIH4 , ovalbumin ( OVA ) , and two OVA + ITIH4 treatment groups at different doses . Lung function and oxygen saturation were measured , and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) was analyzed for white blood cell counts and cytokines . Lung and gut microbiota were profiled using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing , and short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) were measured using gas chromatography mass spectrometry ( GC MS ) . Proteomic profiling of intestinal tissues was conducted to identify ITIH4 associated signaling pathways . RESULTS : ITIH4 administration significantly mitigated OVA induced asthma symptoms by reducing weight loss , airway resistance , and tissue damping ( p < 05 ) . Histological analysis showed decreased airway wall thickening and lung injury scores ( p < 05 ) . ITIH4 also lowered BALF eosinophils and lymphocytes , IgE , and Th2 cytokines ( IL 4 , IL 5 , and IL 13 ) ( p < 05 ) . ITIH4 treatment modulated microbiome composition , enriching Gram positive taxa ( Nocardioidaceae and Acholeplasmataceae ) and depleting Gram negative Helicobacteraceae ( p < 05 ) . SCFAs correlated with microbiome alterations , notably reduced 4 methylpentanoic acid levels ( p < 05 ) . Proteomic analysis revealed a dose dependent activation of granzyme A signaling and suppression of metabolic and solute transport pathways . CONCLUSIONS : ITIH4 ameliorates asthma symptoms by modulating lung and gut microbiota , dampening Th2 driven inflammation , and restoring mucosal immune balance . These findings support ITIH4 as a potential candidate for microbiome targeted asthma therapy .
BACKGROUND : Bladder cancer ( BCa ) , a prevalent malignancy of the urinary tract , is associated with high recurrence and mortality rates . SLC16A7 , a member of the solute carrier family 16 ( SLC16 ) , encodes monocarboxylate transporters that are involved in the proton coupled transport of metabolites , including lactate , pyruvate , and ketone bodies , across cell membranes . Evidence suggests that SLC16A7 exhibits variable expression in cancers and may influence tumor development , progression , and immune regulation . This study examined the role of SLC16A7 in cancer prognosis , progression , and immune regulation , focusing on BCa . METHODS : A comprehensive analysis was conducted to evaluate the clinical and immunological relevance of SLC16A7 across multiple cancer types using data from 33 tumor datasets from ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) . ' Associations between SLC16A7 expression and clinicopathological features , prognostic indicators , tumor mutation burden ( TMB ) , microsatellite instability ( MSI ) , immune cell infiltration , and immune related gene expression were systematically analyzed . Experimental validation was performed to assess SLC16A7 expression in the BCa tissues and cell lines . The prognostic value of SLC16A7 was confirmed using clinical follow up data from an independent patient cohort . Functional studies included proliferation assays to investigate the effect of SLC16A CD8 + T cells were obtained from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and stimulated using CD3 and CD28 antibodies in combination with recombinant IL To investigate the immunological role of SLC16A7 , co culture experiments were performed between BCa cells and activated CD8 + T cells . Additionally , CD8 + T cell chemotaxis assays and ELISA analyses were conducted to evaluate the immune responses mediated by SLC16A RESULTS : SLC16A7 expression was downregulated in 16 cancer types , including BCa , and upregulated in three cancer types . Its expression was significantly associated with tumor stage in four cancers and showed both positive and negative correlations with prognosis , depending on the cancer type . Genomic analyses revealed significant associations between SLC16A7 and TMB in 13 cancer types and MSI in 11 cancer types . Pathway enrichment analyses ( Hallmark GSEA and KEGG GSEA ) indicated strong associations between SLC16A7 , immune responses , and tumor progression . Immune infiltration analysis showed a predominantly positive association between SLC16A7 expression and immune cell infiltration , except in low grade gliomas ( LGG ) . CIBERSORT analysis demonstrated that SLC16A7 expression correlated positively with resting memory CD4 T cells , eosinophils , monocytes , resting mast cells , and memory B cells and negatively with activated memory CD4 T cells , M1 macrophages , follicular helper T cells , M0 macrophages , and CD8 T cells . SLC16A7 expression was also significantly associated with the expression of immune regulatory molecules . Experimental validation showed reduced SLC16A7 expression in BCa tissues and cell lines compared to that in their normal counterparts . Kaplan Meier survival analysis indicated that higher SLC16A7 expression was correlated with better overall survival in patients with BCa . Functional assays revealed that SLC16A7 inhibited BCa cell progression and promoted the chemotaxis and tumor killing ability of CD8 + T cells in the BCa tumor microenvironment ( TME ) . CONCLUSIONS : SLC16A7 exhibits tumor suppressive properties , with downregulation in most cancers , and is associated with favorable prognosis and enhanced immune responses . SLC16A7 functions as a tumor suppressor in BCa and is associated with improved survival outcomes . These findings suggest that SLC16A7 is a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis .
BACKGROUND : The CRP Albumin Lymphocyte ( CALLY ) index , a novel inflammatory biomarker combining serum albumin , lymphocyte count , and C reactive protein ( CRP ) , has been proposed for clinical use . This study aimed to investigate the association between CALLY index and Asthma COPD Overlap ( ACO ) in the general US population . METHODS : We analyzed data from 6 , 797 participants aged >/= 40 years from the 2015 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) . Participants were categorized into quartiles based on natural logarithmic transformed ( ln ) CALLY index . ACO was defined as self reported physician diagnosed asthma and COPD . Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between ln CALLY and ACO , adjusting for potential confounders across three models . Generalized additive models , subgroup analyses , and receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis were also performed . RESULTS : The prevalence of ACO across the four CALLY quartiles was 56% , 89% , 54% , and 66% . In the fully adjusted model , for each 1 unit increase in ln CALLY , the risk of ACO decreased by 43% ( OR = 57 , 95% CI : 44 73 , P = 001 ) . Compared with Q1 , the risk of ACO in Q2 , Q3 , and Q4 was reduced by 63% ( OR = 37 ) , 66% ( OR = 34 ) , and 87% ( OR = 13 ) , respectively ( P for trend = 003 ) . Generalized additive models showed a non linear negative relationship ( P < 001 ) . Subgroup analysis revealed that the association remained consistent across different sexes , age groups , races , smoking status , and disease statuses ( arthritis , DM , and hypertension ) . ROC curve analysis indicated moderate predictive ability of ln CALLY for ACO ( AUC = 675 , 95% CI : 636 714 ) , with an optimal cutoff value of 007 ( sensitivity 669 , specificity 598 ) . CONCLUSION : Higher CALLY index is independently associated with lower risk of ACO , suggesting its potential value as a biomarker for ACO risk assessment in clinical practice . By integrating inflammation , immune , and nutritional status evaluation , the CALLY index offers a novel perspective for early identification of high risk individuals in clinical practice .
BACKGROUND : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) involves systemic inflammation and is often accompanied by comorbidities . Blood eosinophil count ( BEC ) is a key marker of airway inflammation , used for patient stratification and treatment guidance . However , the association between BEC ( < 300 vs . >/= 300 cells/microL ) and pulmonary or extrapulmonary comorbidities in COPD remains unclear . METHODS : This study analyzed COPD patients from the 2013 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) . Weighted multivariable logistic regression models examined associations between BEC and comorbidities , adjusting for potential confounders . Associations were quantified using odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) . RESULTS : A total of 614 COPD patients were included ( 395 with BEC < 300 cells/microL , 219 with BEC >/= 300 cells/microL ) . Patients with BEC >/= 300 cells/microL had a higher prevalence of extrapulmonary comorbidities than those with BEC < 300 cells/microL ( 35% vs . 48% ) . Adjusted analysis showed that BEC >/= 300 cells/microL was significantly associated with increased odds of any extrapulmonary comorbidity ( OR = 03 , 95% CI : 19 44 , p = 009 ) , congestive heart failure ( OR = 69 , 95% CI : 02 82 , p = 043 ) , and renal dysfunction ( OR = 95 , 95% CI : 01 79 , p = 048 ) , but not with pulmonary comorbidities . Sensitivity analyses using 3 and 4 level BEC categories revealed consistent trends , with higher BEC levels significantly associated with greater prevalence of at least one extrapulmonary comorbidity . CONCLUSIONS : In COPD , higher BEC ( >/= 300 cells/microL ) is significantly associated with extrapulmonary comorbidities , particularly congestive heart failure and renal dysfunction , but not pulmonary comorbidities .
OBJECTIVES : We evaluated the utility of routine laboratory test related sarcopenia indices as predictors of mortality in older patients with primary lung cancer undergoing the first chemotherapy course . DESIGN : Retrospective cohort study . SETTING : West China Hospital , Chengdu , China . PARTICIPANTS : This study enrolled primary lung cancer patients >/= 60 years of age undergoing their first chemotherapy course . MEASUREMENTS : Data on individual patients were obtained from the medical records , while information on survival outcomes was gathered through telephone based follow up or local government databases . Using available routine hematological and biochemical test results , this study calculated three sarcopenia related indices for each patient . These indices included the AST/ALT ratio , neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) , and platelet to lymphocyte ratio ( PLR ) . We assessed the relationships between these indices and death using Cox proportional hazards models . RESULTS : The study included 926 primary lung cancer patients ( 5% male ; median age : 65 years ) who underwent their first course of chemotherapy . During the follow up period ( median : 28 months ) , 563 patients ( 8% ) died . In the overall population , there was a significantly higher likelihood of all cause mortality in patients with an NLR >/= 88 ( HR = 60 , 95% CI = 36 90 , P < 001 ) or a PLR >/= 11 ( HR = 39 , 95% CI = 17 64 , P < 001 ) compared to those with values below these thresholds . However , after adjustment for potential confounding factors , no association was found between NLR or PLR and mortality . After stratification by sex , it was found that both NLR and PLR values were associated with an increased risk of mortality among women ( NLR : HR = 1 , P < 001 ; PLR : HR = 42 , P < 001 ) . CONCLUSIONS : NLR and PLR , are indicators of sarcopenia and can be easily derived from routine laboratory testing data . These indices can significantly predict mortality in older female patients with primary lung cancer at the start of chemotherapy . Therefore , there is potential practical value in using these indices for assessing patient risk prior to chemotherapy .
BACKGROUND : One major barrier to the goals of hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) elimination is identification and linkage to care for those with HCV infection . The aim of this research was to develop a strategy to help achieve HCV elimination in remote rural villages . METHODS : According to the maps of the township and village specific testing rates and prevalence rates of anti HCV produced by the Public Health Bureau of Yunlin County , a high anti HCV prevalent township Sihhu and four nearby villages were selected for an intensive screening with anti HCV reflex HCV antigen test . A temporary outreach hepatology clinic was set in Sihhu Township Health Center to enhance accessibility for post screening care of those positive for HCV antigen . RESULTS : The population aged >/= 40 years of the included villages at time of survey was 18 , 018 with 5 , 343 ( 7% , range 8 7% ) having ever been previously screened , and 1 , 503 responded to this screening . The crude screening coverage rate increased to 0% ( range 6 2% ) after this screening campaign . The prevalence rates of anti HCV and HCV antigen were 3% and 3% respectively , with the rate of antigenemia ( HCV antigen/anti HCV ) being 1% . The number needed to test ( NNT ) to find a candidate for anti viral treatment was Patients can choose any medical institution for consultation based on their preference . The local health centers could trace the consultation status of all 125 HCV patients , with 119 of them receiving direct acting antiviral ( DAA ) treatment . Out of the 125 patients with positive HCV antigen , 75 were evaluated at the outreach clinic , with 70 ultimately receiving DAA treatment at the outreach clinic and 5 receiving treatment at other hospitals . Evaluable sustained virological response rate for the 70 patients was 97% . CONCLUSION : Prevalence based screening and accessible outreach clinic can help accelerate HCV elimination in rural villages .
BACKGROUND : Alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L . ) has the benefits of high yield and nutritional value as a sustainable forage . However , the water deficit significantly limits its growth and yield performance . Nitric oxide ( NO ) is a signal molecule that can enhance plant tolerance . The majority of previous studies focus on the role of exogenous NO in plant tolerance . However , the underlying mechanism of endogenous NO in alfalfa drought tolerance remains largely unexplored . RESULTS : To explore the mechanism of the endogenous NO mediated water deficit resistance in the alfalfa , seedlings were exposed to polyethylene glycol 6000 ( PEG ) and NO scavenger ( cPTIO ) . Results showed that PEG treatment significantly augmented alfalfa endogenous NO , MDA , O ( . ) , and HO levels . In parallel , eliminating endogenous NO under PEG stress ( PEG NO ) significantly diminished NO level , exacerbated MDA and reactive oxygen species accumulation , and decreased the activities of key enzymes involved in carbon fixation and TCA cycle , such as Rubisco , FBA , PDH , alpha KGDH , and SDH , as well as reduced ABA and IAA content in alfalfa leaves . RNA Seq and bioinformatics analysis suggested that endogenous NO responsive DEGs primarily relate to carbon metabolism and hormone signal transduction . In further studies of these DEGs , we speculated that GH3 , SAUR , SnRK2 , and ABF genes and FBA , GAPDH , SBP , and CS are critical genes in response to endogenous NO under PEG stress . CONCLUSIONS : In summary , our study innovatively proposes a mechanism model of how endogenous NO enhances alfalfa tolerance to water deficiency at the physiological and molecular levels . The novel candidate genes can give genetic resources for the subsequent molecular assisted breeding of drought resistant alfalfa crops .
BACKGROUND : Fatty liver disease ( FLD ) , characterized by hepatic lipid accumulation , impairs quality of life and can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma , imposing a healthcare burden . This study investigates the association between the aggregate index of systemic inflammation ( AISI ) and FLD prevalence , evaluating AISI ' s potential as an early biomarker for risk assessment . METHODS : Data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) database , which encompasses the years 2017 through Participants were chosen based on the availability of controlled attenuation parameter ( CAP ) scores derived from transient elastography ( TE ) , a technique utilized for assessing liver steatosis . The formula employed to compute the AISI is as follows : AISI = N x P x M / L , where N , P , M , and L refer to neutrophils , platelets , monocytes , and lymphocytes , respectively . Additionally , demographic , socioeconomic , dietary , and health related information was gathered . Logistic regression models were utilized to pinpoint risk factors associated with FLD , and a nomogram was created to forecast FLD risk . RESULTS : Of the 3 , 961 participants , 2 , 377 ( 0% ) were diagnosed with FLD based on a CAP score >/= 248 dB/m . Elevated AISI was significantly associated with FLD ( P = 021 ) . Other significant risk factors included sex , age , BMI , race , marital status , hypertension , and diabetes . The nomogram demonstrated excellent discriminatory performance with an AUC of 814 ( 95% CI : 800 , 827 ) and good calibration . CONCLUSION : This study reveals a significant , independent association between elevated AISI and increased FLD risk in the U . S . population , even after adjusting for confounders . AISI demonstrated good discriminative performance for FLD , but its effect size suggests it should supplement , not replace , existing clinical risk assessment tools . AISI , a cost effective biomarker , holds potential for enhancing FLD screening , particularly in resource limited settings .
BACKGROUND : Pomegranate is susceptible to low temperature . Controlled atmosphere ( CA ) with high CO concentration can prolong storage life by affecting fruit quality . Our study probed into the effect of CA storage on the pomegranate fruit quality as well as antioxidant attributes at 5 ℃ for 30 d , plus at 18 ℃ for 9 d in simulate marketing conditions . The atmosphere compositions of 7% O + 4% CO ( CA1 ) and 2% O + 5% CO ( CA2 ) were chosen , the regular air as control ( CK ) . RESULTS : In arils , the highest contents of total phenols , total flavonoids , and anthocyanins were all found after CA2 treatment , significantly higher 04 g kg ( 1 ) FW , 19 g kg ( 1 ) FW , and 70 g L ( 1 ) FW than those in CA1 , respectively . Also , the highest enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , glutathione reductase ( GR ) , and ascorbate peroxidase ( APX ) in husks were presented in CA2 , 30% , 05% , and 36% , higher than in CA1 , respectively . Thus , CA2 treatment maintained better husk appearance due to significantly reducing chilling injury , malondialdehyde content , electrolyte leakage , and two enzymes activity , including peroxidase ( POD ) and/or polyphenol oxidase ( PPO ) , meanwhile improving phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( PAL ) enzyme activity . Also , CA2 effectively maintained the postharvest quality and reduced nutrition loss for fresh pomegranate fruit by reducing respiration rate , maintaining suitable energy charge , increasing ROS scavenging ability . CONCLUSIONS : Totally , 2% O + 5% CO ( relative higher CO concentration ) could prolong the storage life of pomegranate fruit during cold storage by regulating antioxidant capacity and respiration metabolism , both higher nutrition value and better appearance .
BACKGROUND : Phytohormones play pivotal roles in regulating floral development and secondary metabolite synthesis in saffron ( Crocus sativus L . ) . RESULTS : This study investigated the effects of gibberellin ( GA ) , abscisic acid ( ABA ) , cytokinin ( CK ) , and strigolactone ( SL ) on floral differentiation , stigma quality , crocin yield , and endogenous hormonal dynamics . GA significantly accelerated floral bud differentiation and apical bud elongation during reproductive transition , increasing flower number by 5% compared to the control . While CK also enhanced flowering ( 6% increase ) , ABA and SL showed milder effects . Intriguingly , ABA treatment markedly elevated crocin content , boosting crocin 1 and 2 levels by 5% and 2% , respectively , and total crocin yield per corm by 7 fold the highest among all treatments . Endogenous hormone levels were dynamically regulated , with GA and ABA treatments upregulating endogenous ABA . However , qRT PCR analysis revealed downregulated expression of ABA biosynthesis genes ( ZEP and NCED ) under GA and ABA treatments . CONCLUSIONS : These findings highlight GA as the most effective hormone for increasing flower number and ABA as the optimal choice for enhancing crocin content . This study provides actionable insights for hormone mediated agronomic strategies to simultaneously improve saffron ' s ornamental and medicinal value .
BACKGROUND : Data on quality of care indicators for breast cancer patients is limited in low and middle income countries . We evaluated the indicators in Iran . METHOD : A total of 21 quality of care indicators of breast cancer management defined by EUSOMA 2017 were selected . The indicators were retrospectively evaluated based on the data from the Clinical Breast Cancer Registry established in 11 provinces of Iran . RESULT : In the study of 6 , 293 patients evaluated on 21 indicators , 15 indicators were more than 5% below EUSOMA ' s standard levels . CONCLUSION : The defined indicators had a value lower than the suggested standards by EUSOMA . This study ' s results highlight important clues for intervention in improving breast cancer outcomes in Iran and other low and middle income countries .
BACKGROUND : The resilience of plants against environmental challenges , particularly salinity and dehydration , is crucial for global food security . This study delves into the intricate interaction between NaCl induced salinity and Azolla aqueous extract ( AAE ) . In a pot trial , wheat kernels were primed with deionized water or 1% AAE for 21 h . Seedlings underwent various treatments ; tap water , 250 mM NaCl , AAE priming and spray , and combined AAE with NaCl treatments . Seedlings were analyzed for ionic balance , secondary metabolism , antioxidant efficacy , and molecular response to experimental treatments . RESULTS : GC MS analysis of AAE revealed key components like gamma aminobutyric acid and benzenedicarboxylic acid . Exposure to 250 mM NaCl significantly reduced N , P , Ca , K , and the K/Na ratio , while increases in Mg and Na . Also , salinity significantly decreased TAC , DPPH activity , and AsA levels while increasing GB in wheat seedlings . Additionally , salinity increased flavonoids , saponins , and anthocyanins but non significantly decreased phenols . qRT PCR analysis revealed upregulation of DRF1 , CBF3 , HQT , CHS , and FLS genes and downregulation of CBF4 and CHI genes by salinity . AAE treatments , alone or combined with salt stress , mitigated Na accumulation ( 50 and 87% compared to stressed seedlings ) , improved N and P levels , alleviated Mg , K/Na , and GB imbalances , and enhanced antioxidant potentials . Combined AAE and NaCl treatments effectually restored antioxidant potentials and regulated secondary metabolites and gene expressions , sustaining enhancement of ionic equilibrium , antioxidant defenses , and molecular responses in salt stressed wheat . CONCLUSIONS : Overall , AAE can be exploited as a green approach for sustaining normal metabolism and gene expression of wheat seedlings in saline soils .
BACKGROUND : The abnormal chloroplast and pigment accumulation could lead to plant yellowing . However , the plant tissue chlorisis is species specific and could display various phenotypes due to the genetic and environmental impacts . The molecular mechanisms underlying the plant stem yellowing are less understood than the flower or leaf coloring mechanisms . Herein , the physiological , cytological , transcriptome analysis , along with genome wide association study ( GWAS ) were integrated to illustrate the processes relevant to pumpkin stem coloring . RESULTS : Similar yet different variations were discovered in the pumpkin yellow stems . Low content of photosynthetic pigments , and impaired chloroplast thylakoid membrane were identified in the pumpkin yellowing stems , together with the presence of plastoglobules and starch grains . Elevated expression of genes in catabolism of chlorophylls and carotenoids was found in yellow stems , which may result in the failed accumulation of pigments and pumpkin stem chlorisis . Concurrently , increased expression of genes in chloroplast development , antioxidant protection , photosynthesis , and ribosome were found , which may act as compensation mechanisms for chloroplast defects . The integrated analysis of transcriptome and GWAS identified the up regulated proteases and decreased kinesins in yellow stems , which could result in the breakdown of thylakoid systems , and the disability of photosynthetic pigments accumulation . Additionally , transcription factors could be involved in the regulation of the specific color change in pumpkin stems . CONCLUSIONS : These findings provide clues into the molecular mechanisms of stem yellowing , and will facilitate the exploration of candidate targets as markers or genetic improvement through molecular breeding .
The JAK family , particularly JAK3 , plays a crucial role in immune signaling and inflammatory responses . Dysregulated JAK3 activation in SARS CoV 2 infections has been associated with severe inflammation and respiratory complications , making JAK inhibitors a viable therapeutic option . However , their use raises concerns regarding immunosuppression , which could increase susceptibility to secondary infections . While long term adverse effects are less of a concern in acute COVID 19 treatment , patient selection and monitoring remain critical . Furthermore , adverse effects associated with oral JAK3 inhibitors necessitate the exploration of alternative strategies to optimize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing risks . This review highlights the role of JAK3 in immune and epithelial cells , examines the adverse effects of oral JAK3 inhibitors in COVID 19 and other treatments , and discusses alternative therapeutic strategies for improving patient outcomes .
BACKGROUND : Flowering is a tightly regulated process influencing yield and promoting plant genetic diversity and conservation . Orchardgrass ( Dactylis glomerata ) exhibits excellent yield traits and stress resistance , making it ideal for animal husbandry and ecological restoration . However , the molecular regulatory factors of the flowering time of orchardgrass are still unknown , limiting its molecular breeding . RESULTS : To speed up molecular breeding to enhance flowering traits in orchardgrass , we conducted a genome wide association study ( GWAS ) . A diverse panel of 249 orchardgrass accessions was phenotyped for heading stage and flowering time . GWAS analysis identified 359 candidate genes that overlapped or were adjacent to effective single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , which were considered potential flowering time related genes . Furthermore , we validated that formin like protein 18 ( DgFH18 ) and choline monooxygenase ( DgCMO like ) was two important flowering candidate genes by overexpressing them in Arabidopsis to unravel their potential functions . Overexpression of DgFH18 and DgCMO like positively regulated flowering time by inducing the expression of flowering related genes . Moreover , sucrose treatment could significantly promote the expression of flavonoid pathway genes and enhance the content of total flavonoids and anthocyanins in the DgCMO like overexpressing lines compared to the wild type . CONCLUSION : These results provide valuable resources for future orchardgrass breeding programs and broaden the current comprehension of flowering time regulation in perennial grasses .
The Trihelix transcription factor family , characterized by its unique triple helix structure ( helix loop helix loop helix ) , plays a significant role in plant growth , development , and responses to various abiotic stresses . Potato ( Solanum tuberosum L . ) , as a globally important food crop , experiences significant impacts on its growth and yield due to abiotic stresses such as drought , low temperature , and salt stress . Although the functions of Trihelix transcription factors have been extensively studied in various plants , systematic analysis in potatoes remains relatively scarce . This study aims to comprehensively identify the Trihelix gene family in potatoes through bioinformatics methods and analyze their expression patterns under abiotic stresses to reveal the potential functions of this gene family in potato growth , development , and stress responses . Through genome database searches and BLAST comparisons , 35 StTrihelix genes were identified in potatoes , and phylogenetic , gene structure , functional motif , and cis acting element analyses were conducted . The expression patterns of these genes in different tissues and under low temperature and drought stresses were analyzed using qRT PCR technology . Additionally , the nuclear localization of StTrihelix30 was verified through subcellular localization experiments . The results indicate that the 35 StTrihelix genes are unevenly distributed across 12 chromosomes and can be classified into five subfamilies : GT 1 , GT 2 , GTgamma , SH4 , and SIP Gene structure and functional motif analyses revealed high conservation within the same subfamily . Cis acting element analysis showed that these genes are closely related to hormone responses , stress responses , and growth and development processes . Tissue expression analysis showed that StTrihelix4 is highly expressed in stamens , while StTrihelix13 is highly expressed in roots . qRT PCR results indicated that most StTrihelix genes are significantly upregulated under low temperature and drought stresses . This study systematically identified the Trihelix gene family in potatoes and revealed its important role in abiotic stress responses . It provides new insights into the functions of the Trihelix transcription factor family in potato growth , development , and stress adaptation , offering theoretical references for stress resistant potato breeding .
BACKGROUND : The Anterior Cruciate Ligament ( ACL ) plays a critical role in maintaining the musculoskeletal stability of the knee . Its injury has been linked to an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis . This study aims to identify cross species responses to ACL rupture providing insights on its molecular basis . We analyzed five publicly available transcriptomic datasets from Homo sapiens , Mus musculus , Canis lupus familiaris , and Oryctolagus cuniculus . Differential gene expression analysis was performed for each dataset , producing a genome wide transcriptional signature of fold change significance for individual genes . Stouffer ' s method was used to integrate the results , identifying genes significantly deregulated across all species . Additionally , gene set enrichment analysis revealed pathways that were consistently upregulated or downregulated . RESULTS : A positive correlation in expression was observed between human and the other three species ( r = 177 305 , p value </= 7 x 10 ( 113 ) ) , identifying 210 genes as the most consistently up and down regulated in response to ACL rupture ( p adjusted </= 27 x 10 ( 23 ) ) . These genes are primarily involved in cellular mitosis , collagen pathways , and cartilage development . Furthermore , 60 pathways were found to be significantly up or down regulated across all species ( p adjusted </= 57 x 10 ( 4 ) ) . Among these , the upregulation of inhibition of bone mineralization ( p adjusted </= 99 x 10 ( 6 ) ) aligns with previous findings on the reduction of subchondral bone mineral density following ACL rupture . CONCLUSIONS : This study highlights that distinct species exhibit common molecular responses to ACL rupture , underscoring the value of mice , dogs , and rabbits as potential translational model organisms for ACL rupture research . Furthermore , the identified genes and pathways highlight the molecular mechanisms underlying ACL rupture .
OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to investigate how variations in body composition impact the likelihood and location of fragility fractures in older adults . METHODS : Data of US adults aged >/= 60 years with fragility fracture and body dimension records ( n = 13177 , representing approximately 334 million US elderly adults ) were from NHANES between 1999 and March We calculated body composition parameters , including the body roundness index ( BRI ) , weight adjusted waist index ( WWI ) , abdominal visceral fat index ( AVI ) , and arm to waist circumference ratio ( AC/WC ) . Linear regression analyzed trends in site specific fragility fractures , while logistic regression assessed the separate and joint effects of parameters . RESULTS : Fragility fractures increased , especially among elderly with central obesity . A rounded body shape ( OR ( 42 </= BRI </= 60 ) = 6 , 95% CI , 4 9 ; OR ( 61 </= BRI </= 00 ) = 5 , 95% CI , 3 8 ; OR ( BRI >/=01 ) = 4 , 95% CI , 2 8 ) and a balanced arm to waist size ( OR ( 32 </= AC/WC </= 33 ) = 6 , 95% CI , 4 9 ) reduced the risk of hip fractures , and a moderate fat content ( OR ( 45 cm/ radicalkg </=WWI</=93 cm/ radicalkg ) = 6 ; 95% CI , 4 0 ) lowered the risk of vertebral fractures . Joint analyses found that moderate built ( OR ( BRI < 42 , 96 cm/ radicalkg </=WWI</=44 cm/ radicalkg ) = 9 , 95% CI , 3 0 ) elderly faced doubled risk of hip fractures compared to those with severe central obesity ( BRI >/= 01 , WWI 45 93 cm/ radicalkg ) , while mild obesity ( OR ( 61</= BRI</=00 , WWI < 96 cm/ radicalkg ) = 1 , 95% CI , 0 6 ) carried only 10% of this risk . A stocky physique ( OR ( BRI >/= 01 , AVI 48 44 cm/1000 ) = 6 , 95% CI , 1 1 ) was a significant risk factor for vertebral fragility fractures , while fit individuals with strong arms ( OR ( BRI < 42 , AC/WC >/= 34 ) = 7 , 95% CI , 5 0 ) experienced a lower incidence of vertebral fractures . CONCLUSIONS : This population based cohort study identified distinct risk groups for fragility fractures and clearly visualized these high risk populations , which contributes to preventing fragility fractures and reduce the risk of second fractures .
INTRODUCTION : The long term relationship between hemoglobin to serum creatinine ( HB/SCr ) ratio and clinical outcomes in ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) remains uncertain . This study aimed to determine the predictive value of the HB/SCr ratio for long term major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) in patients with STEMI . METHODS : This study was based on a prospective cohort conducted in China , which included 460 STEMI patients who successfully underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention . Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to explore the relationship between the HB/SCr ratio and MACE in STEMI patients over a 30 month follow up period . The predictive value of the HB/SCr ratio for MACE was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve . RESULTS : A total of 118 patients ( 26% ) developed MACE during the follow up period . After adjusting for confounding factors , a lower HB/SCr ratio emerged as a significant predictor of MACE in STEMI patients . Subgroup analyses indicated that the HB/SCr ratio was inversely associated with MACE in patients aged >/= 60 years , males , those with a history of hypertension , individuals experiencing anterior wall myocardial infarction , patients classified as Killip grade I , and those receiving single stent implantation . Sensitivity analysis revealed that the inverse association between the HB/SCr ratio and MACE occurrence persisted in patients with normal hemoglobin levels . The area under the curve for the HB/SCr ratio in predicting MACE was CONCLUSIONS : The baseline HB/SCr ratio was inversely associated with MACE , suggesting that it may serve as a useful biomarker for identifying high risk STEMI patients at an early stage .
BACKGROUND : Sorghum grains are rich in phenolic compounds , which are noted for their anticancer , antioxidant , and anti inflammatory properties , as well as volatile compounds ( VOCs ) that contribute to aroma and fermentation processes . There is a known close relationship between sorghum coat color and phenolic compound content ( PCC ) , particularly flavonoids which are pigments that confer red and purple colors in flowers and seeds . RESULTS : Our results showed that black seeds had the highest total tannin content ( TTC ) and ketone content , which were measured at 7 mg CE g 1 and 96 g 100 g 1 , respectively , which were 87 and 35 fold higher than those of white seeds . L* showed a negative correlation between TTC ( r = 770 , P < 01 ) and ketone ( r = 814 , P < 01 ) , while TFC and a* showed a strong positive correlation ( r = 829 , P < 001 ) . RNA sequencing analysis identified 1 , 422 up regulated and 1 , 586 down regulated differentially expressed genes . Weighted gene co expression analysis highlighted two color related gene modules : the magenta 2 module associated with TTC , TPC , VOCs and L* value , and the blue module associated with TFC , and a* values . Hub genes identified within these modules included ABCB28 in the magenta 2 module , and PTCD1 and ANK in the blue module . CONCLUSIONS : We confirmed the relationship between PCC , VOCs , and seed coat color , with darker seed coat colors showing higher tannin , ketone contents and redder colors indicating higher flavonoid content . Network analysis helped pinpoint key genes involved in these traits . This study will provide essential data for improving the food and industrial use of sorghum .
The increasing impacts of climate change , global warming , and water scarcity are intensifying drought risk and compromising global food security . To mitigate these challenges , green synthesized nanoparticles ( NPs ) derived from plant extracts have recently emerged as an innovative tool for enhancing crop resilience to abiotic stresses such as drought . Moringa enables eco friendly nanoparticle production with diverse uses . Although Moringa enhances plant traits and its NPs have antimicrobial properties , limited research exists on their ability to improve plant tolerance to abiotic stress . Here , we investigated the potential of copper oxide ( CuO ) nanoparticles synthesized from Moringa plant extracts to alleviate drought stress in tomato plants ( Solanum lycopersicum ) . The Moringa based CuO NPs were characterized via UV‒Vis spectrophotometry , Zeta potential , FTIR , SEM , and TEM . Foliar applications of the NPs at various concentrations ( 3 , 6 , and 9 mg/L ) were tested on tomato seedlings under normal and drought induced conditions ( 10% PEG ) , alongside two controls : non stressed control ( water treatment ) and drought stress control ( PEG treatment ) . Physiological assessments showed that 6 mg/L Moringa based CuO NPs were most effective under drought stress , significantly reducing leaf yellowing and increasing shoot length by 11% , root length by 21% , total dry biomass by 34% increase , and total chlorophyll content by 32% increase at ( p < 05 ) compared to the drought stress control . Furthermore , at the molecular level , gene expression analysis revealed the upregulation of PAL , CHS , and HQT , which are genes critical to the stress response and secondary metabolism in tomato plants . Notably , the combination of CuO NPs with PEG amplified gene expression , indicating a synergistic effect on improving drought tolerance . These findings highlight the potential of the use of Moringa synthesized CuO nanoparticles as a sustainable , eco friendly strategy to mitigate drought stress in economic crops such as tomatoes . This new green approach offers a promising solution for bolstering food security in the face of climate change and water scarcity challenges .
Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) is a highly malignant tumor with a poor prognosis , underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies . RCC cells exhibit rapid proliferation and high metabolic demands , leading to hypoglycemic and hypoxic conditions within the tumor microenvironment ( TME ) . Our study reveals that the fructose transporter Glut5 is prominently expressed in RCC , facilitating increased fructose uptake . This compensatory mechanism supports RCC survival under glucose deprivation and hypoxia . Fructose utilization sustains RCC proliferation , migration , and colony formation in vitro , significantly reduces apoptosis , and accelerates renal cancer growth in vivo . Mechanistically , fructose activates the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway , driving metabolic reprogramming and promoting tumor progression . Furthermore , 2 , 5 dehydro D mannitol ( 2 , 5 AM ) , a competitive inhibitor of fructose transport , significantly inhibits RCC growth both in vivo and in vitro . These findings provide new insights into the role of fructose metabolism in RCC progression and suggest potential therapeutic targets .
Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) remains a major global health challenge with a need for improved diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers . This study aimed to evaluate the biomarker potential of extracellular vesicle ( EV ) encapsulated glial fibrillary acidic protein ( EV GFAP ) , neurofilament light chain ( EV NfL ) , total tau ( EV T Tau ) , and ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolase L1 ( EV UCH L1 ) in TBI . A cohort of 93 trauma patients ( 75 with TBI and 18 without TBI ) was analyzed . Patients were sampled on admission , as well as 15 and 72 h post injury . Following initial method validation , EVs were isolated from plasma using size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) , and plasma levels and EV cargo levels of biomarkers were measured using an ultra sensitive Single Molecule Array . EV GFAP levels were significantly elevated in TBI patients compared to non TBI trauma patients at admission and 15 h . A positive head CT was associated with 85 ( 95% CI : 18 91 ) fold increased EV GFAP , whereas EV NfL , EV T Tau , and EV UCH L1 levels were not affected . None of the tested EV biomarkers were associated with 1 year mortality or 6 12 months ' functional outcome . Plasma GFAP levels increased 4 ( 95% CI : 72 70 ) fold with a positive head CT but were not associated with outcomes . EV GFAP shows potential as an early biomarker of TBI , but plasma GFAP remains a practical and reliable alternative . Future studies should explore the potential complementary roles of EV based biomarkers on alternative aspects of TBI pathophysiology and prediction of long term outcomes . Studies should refine methods to enhance reproducibility and clinical applicability .

Endocrine therapy ( ET ) is essential for managing ER+ HER2 breast cancer ; however , resistance remains a significant clinical challenge . This study investigated whether CD44 SLC1A2 gene fusions , reported in gastrointestinal malignancies , contribute to ET resistance mechanisms in breast cancer . Although no CD44 SLC1A2 fusions were detected , high expression of CD44 and SLC1A2 was associated with poor survival outcomes and identified a therapy resistant subpopulation sustained by aspartate and glutamate metabolism , highlighting potential metabolic vulnerabilities for future therapeutic intervention .
Mercury contamination in commercial products poses serious risks to human health and the environment . The in vitro detection methods using spectroscopy approaches are expensive and have limited practical use . Yeast based biosensors provide a more affordable and user friendly alternative . Therefore , the exploration of mercury tolerance yeast is essential to support the sensor properties . In this study , we investigated the mercury tolerance of 10 yeast isolates . Pichia kudriavzevii 1P4 exhibited tolerance up to 5 mM HgCl while showing slow growth phenotype as grown in 2 mM HgCl . This is the first report to show the ability of this genus of the yeast Pichia to cope with HgCl stress . X ray spectra showed Hg accumulation in yeast colonies grown in HgCl2 , while none was detected in colonies grown without it . This data indicates the capability of 1P4 in the accumulation of Hg as one of the HgCl stress tolerance mechanisms . Whole genome sequencing of isolate 1P4 , using the MGI DNBSEQ G400 platform , revealed a genome size of 8 Mbp across five chromosomes , with a GC content of 97% . The largest portions of the genome are involved in translation , amino acid transport , metabolism , and protein modification , based on COG analysis . Key genes potentially contributing to mercury tolerance involve efflux/inorganic ion transport system ( e . g . , FieF , Acr3/B , and CzcO/D clusters ) and glutathione associated oxidative stress response ( e . g . , BtuE and LysX , which encoded glutathione peroxidase and glutathione synthase ) . Those genes were predominant in COG category of inorganic ion transport and metabolism ( P ) and defense mechanisms ( V ) . The genome of 1P4 was assembled into 4753 gene clusters , where 2222 of which were shared with the other species of yeast , including Pichia membranifaciens , P . kluyveri , P . inconspicua , S . cerevisiae , and C . albicans . Meanwhile , 921 gene clusters were shared among genera of Pichia spp . , only . These findings highlight the genetic profile and mercury tolerance mechanisms of isolate 1P4 , supporting its potential application as a mercury biosensor or bioremediation agent .
Adults of Aulacophora lewisii Baly ( Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae ) defoliate Luffa acutangula ( L . ) Roxb . plants , and lessen its production . Successful oviposition by herbivorous insects on their host is an important factor in the host acceptance process . In this context , it is important to investigate whether leaf surface wax chemicals from three ridge gourd cultivars ( Abhiskar , Debsundari and Jaipur Long ) could serve as short range attractants and stimulate oviposition in A . lewisii females . Surface waxes were isolated from each leaf using the gum arabic method . Twenty one n alkanes from n C to n C and nine free fatty acids ( FFAs ) from C12 : 0 to C19 : 0 were detected and quantified by GC MS and GC FID , respectively . One leaf equivalent surface wax ( LESW ) of each cultivar or a synthetic blend consisting of n alkanes and FFAs mimicking one LESW of the same cultivar served as attractants through Y tube olfactometer bioassays and stimulated oviposition in A . lewisii females . However , one LESW of Jaipur Long or a synthetic blend of n alkanes and FFAs mimicking one LESW of Jaipur Long served as more potent oviposition stimuli in females than one LESW or synthetic blends mimicking one LESW of the other two cultivars . In field trials , a synthetic blend of pentadecane , heptadecane , pentacosane , hexacosane and linoleic acid mimicking Jaipur Long at mole ratios of 1 : 45 : 68 : 38 : 62 at 6 g/ml petroleum ether when used as lure in funnel traps resulted in attraction of A . lewisii . Hence , the above synthetic blend could be used as a lure in baited traps in eco friendly pest management strategies .
Grain chalkiness is an undesirable agronomic trait that negatively affects both the yield and quality of rice ( Oryza sativa ) . The molecular mechanisms underlying chalky grain phenotype have remained largely unclear . In this study , we selected the rice variety HK300 with a high chalkiness , and ZR24D with a low chalkiness , as experimental materials and systematically characterized the reasons of grain chalkiness formation at molecular level by means of RNA seq analysis . Analysis results revealed that the differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) in these two rice varieties were significantly enriched in transcriptional regulation , sucrose and starch metabolism , and phytohormone signal transduction . Moreover , we found the expression of 13 genes related to trehalose pathway ( 4 out of 14 TPS genes and 9 out of 13 TPP genes in rice genome ) were significantly different between the two varieties , indicating trehalose synthesis pathways may contribute to the increased chalkiness formation . Notably , the number of DEGs associated with the signal transduction pathway for indole 3 acetic acid ( IAA ) , which has been rarely studied for its involvement in chalkiness formation , was the highest among those associated with plant hormone signal transduction . Among them , the expression of two IAA receptor genes , OsAFB3 and OsAFB5 , were significantly lower in HK300 than that in ZR24D through RNA seq and qRT PCR . Furthermore , we newly validated the two genes negatively regulated the formation of chalkiness through gene knockout . Our findings provided the theoretical basis and novel gene resources for molecular breeding aimed at improving rice quality .
Cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome ( CAPS ) is a condition characterized by dominant genetic variants in the NLRP3 gene , which lead to the formation of constitutively active inflammasomes . These inflammasomes play a crucial role in CAPS patients ' inflammatory episodes , these being primarily driven by the production of interleukin ( IL ) 1b . Although treatment with IL 1 blockers is effective for CAPS , some patients develop refractory responses and adverse reactions to these therapies . Consequently , there is a need for novel treatments for CAPS patients . Promising candidates are the derivatives of itaconate , which have been shown to impair NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL 1beta release in blood mononuclear cells from CAPS patients . In this study , we provide insight into the inhibitory mechanisms by which the itaconate derivative 4 octyl itaconate ( 4 OI ) acts on NLRP3 that has different gain of function mutations ( p . R262W , p . D305N and p . T350M ) associated with CAPS . Notably , 4 OI effectively blocks the basal auto activation of the inflammasome formed by NLRP3 p . R262W , p . D305N and p . T350M variants , which in turn reduces caspase 1 activation , gasdermin D processing , and IL 18 release . Furthermore , after lipopolysaccharide priming of macrophages , 4 OI also decreases IL 1beta gene expression and release . Overall , 4 OI impairs CAPS associated inflammasome function at multiple levels , meaning that therapeutic agents based on itaconate could be a promising therapeutic approach to managing inflammatory episodes in CAPS patients carrying p . R262W , p . D305N or p . T350M variants .
Congenital ptosis , a genetic disorder involving levator palpebrae muscle dysfunction , is often associated with congenital myopathy . The genetic causes of this condition remain poorly understood . In this study , we identified FOXK2 mutations in five pedigrees with congenital myopathy and ptosis through whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing . Zebrafish with foxk2 deficiency exhibited underdeveloped skeletal muscles and reduced mobility , while mice with Foxk2 deletion in skeletal muscle stem cells ( MuSCs ) showed generalized skeletal muscle abnormalities . Further analysis revealed that FOXK2 deficiency impaired myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells and disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis in both mouse MuSCs and C2C12 cells . Rescue experiments confirmed the loss of function effects of FOXK2 mutation . Coenzyme Q10 treatment improved mitochondrial function and alleviated skeletal muscle development defects in Foxk2 deficient mice . Preliminary omics analysis suggested FOXK2 directly regulates the expression of mitochondrial function related genes by modulating chromatin accessibility at its binding sites . Our study identifies FOXK2 as a novel pathogenic gene for congenital myopathy with ptosis and highlights its essential role in skeletal muscle development and mitochondrial homeostasis , offering insights for potential diagnostics and therapies .
Environmental factors restrict malaria parasite development , but the influence of host metabolic variations on the infectivity of the blood stage parasite is not fully understood . Here we show that mice on a ketogenic diet are completely protected from infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei . We further show that administration of the ketone body beta hydroxybutyrate ( betaOHB ) , but not of acetoacetate , increases survival of infected mice and inhibits proliferation of both P . berghei and Plasmodium falciparum in vitro . Administration of either a ketogenic diet or betaOHB induces metabolic reprogramming in parasites , including reduced levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , which is associated with the downregulation of genes controlling parasite development , erythrocyte invasion and pathogenicity . Our data indicate that a ketogenic diet and the ketone body betaOHB confer resistance to malaria in mice by causing developmental arrest of Plasmodium parasites , highlighting the potential of dietary and metabolic strategies to fight malarial infection .
As lifestyle related diseases like obesity , dyslipidemia , and non alcoholic fatty liver disease are increasing globally , the demand for developing therapeutic agents and health foods remains high . However , there is a growing concern worldwide regarding the use of animals for biological testing . Herein , we developed a method using the silkworm , Bombyx mori , to evaluate the effects of compounds on improving obesity and lipid metabolism . A silkworm obesity and lipid metabolism disorder ( SOLD ) model , fed a 10% glucose diet for 72 h showed increased fat body weight and accumulation of neutral fat in the hemolymph and fat body . Administration of fenofibrate reduced neutral fat levels in the hemolymph , and epigallocatechin gallate reduced neutral fat levels in the hemolymph and fat body . Silkworms with improved lipid metabolism , exhibited activation of lipoprotein lipase in muscle tissue , and decreased activities of acetyl CoA carboxylase , and activation of AMPK in the fat body . Furthermore , enhanced fatty acid beta oxidation contributed to the promotion of lipolysis . These effects and mechanisms of action observed in silkworms are similar to those found in mammals . These results demonstrate the usefulness of the evaluation system in screening materials for their anti obesity and lipid metabolism improvement effects using the SOLD model .
The SARS CoV 2 pandemic has reemphasized the urgent need for broad spectrum antiviral therapies . We developed a computational workflow using scRNA Seq data to assess cellular metabolism during viral infection . With this workflow we predicted the capacity of cells to sustain SARS CoV 2 virion production in patients and found a tissue wide induction of metabolic pathways that support viral replication . Expanding our analysis to influenza A and dengue viruses , we identified metabolic targets and inhibitors for potential broad spectrum antiviral treatment . These targets were highly enriched for known interaction partners of all analyzed viruses . Indeed , phenformin , an NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase inhibitor , suppressed SARS CoV 2 and dengue virus replication . Atpenin A5 , blocking succinate dehydrogenase , inhibited SARS CoV 2 , dengue virus , respiratory syncytial virus , and influenza A virus with high selectivity indices . In vivo , phenformin showed antiviral activity against SARS CoV 2 in a Syrian hamster model . Our work establishes host metabolism as druggable for broad spectrum antiviral strategies , providing invaluable tools for pandemic preparedness .
Malaria control faces challenges from widespread insecticide resistance in major Anopheles species . This study , employing a cross species approach , integrates RNA Sequencing , whole genome sequencing , and microarray data to elucidate drivers of insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae complex and An . funestus . Here we show an inverse relationship between genetic diversity and gene expression , with highly expressed genes experiencing stronger purifying selection . Gene expression clusters physically in the genome , revealing potential coordinated regulation , and we find that highly over expressed genes are associated with selective sweep loci . We identify known and novel candidate insecticide resistance genes , enriched for metabolic , cuticular , and behavioural functioning . We also present AnoExpress , a Python package , and an online interface for user friendly exploration of resistance candidate expression . Despite millions of years of speciation , convergent gene expression responses to insecticidal selection pressures are observed across Anopheles species , providing crucial insights for malaria vector control .
Boys ' pubertal overweight associates with future offspring ' s asthma and low lung function . To identify how paternal overweight is associated with offspring ' s DNA methylation ( DNAm ) , we conducted an epigenome wide association study of father ' s body silhouette ( FBS ) at three timepoints ( age 8 , voice break and 30 ) and change in FBS between these times , with offspring DNAm , in the RHINESSA cohort ( N = 339 ) . We identified 2005 differentially methylated cytosine phosphate guanine ( dmCpG ) sites ( FDR < 05 ) , including dmCpGs associated with offspring asthma , lung function and BMI . Voice break FBS associated with dmCpGs in loci including KCNJ10 , FERMT1 , NCK2 and WWP Change in FBS across sexual maturation associated with DNAm at loci including NOP10 , TRRAP , EFHD1 , MRPL17 and NORD59A ; ATP5B and showed strong correlation in reduced gene expression in loci NAP1L5 , ATP5B , ZNF695 , ZNF600 , VTRNA2 1 , SOAT2 and AGPAT We identified 24 imprinted genes including : VTRNA2 1 , BLCAP , WT1 , NAP1L5 and PTPRN Identified pathways relate to lipid and glucose metabolism and adipogenesis . Father ' s overweight at puberty and during reproductive maturation was strongly associated with offspring DNA , suggesting a key role for epigenetic mechanisms in intergenerational transfer from father to offspring in humans . The results support an important vulnerability window in male puberty for future offspring health .
In this study , the oral bioaccessibility of potentially toxic elements ( PTEs ) ( As , Ba , Cu , Sb , and Zn ) in river sediments from the abandoned Remance Mine was evaluated , and the associated human health risks from exposure to these contaminants through accidental ingestion during recreational activities were assessed using a probabilistic approach . The pseudo total concentrations and bioaccessible fractions ( BAF ) of the selected PTEs were determined using the Unified BARGE Method ( UBM ) , which simulates the human digestive process for both the gastric ( G phase ) and gastrointestinal ( GI phase ) phases . The results indicate that the BAF of PTEs was higher in the G phase than in the GI phase . In the G phase , the BAF followed this decreasing order : Cu > Ba > Zn > As > Sb , while in the GI phase , the order was Cu > Zn > Ba > As > Sb . Regarding the risk assessment , As emerged as the most significant contaminant , exceeding the safe exposure limits for both carcinogenic ( CR ) and non carcinogenic ( HQ ) risk , mainly in children . The CR for the pseudo total concentration was 10 times higher than in the G phase and 18 times higher than in the GI phase . The HQ results indicated values exceeding the safe exposure threshold only in the pseudo total concentration . These findings highlight that the incorporation of bioaccessibility into risk assessments provides more accurate estimates . This is a novel study , the first one carried out in Panama , which investigates the oral bioaccessibility of potentially toxic elements ( PTEs ) in stream sediments from the Remance gold mine , an area with high concentrations of As , Cu , Zn , Sb , and Ba . Finally , the importance of managing river use in contaminated mining environments is underscored , and some recommendations are provided , aimed to make these sustainable .
Diabetic retinopathy is a retinal damage , which causes vision impairment and blindness . Integrin Subunit Alpha 5 ( ITGA5 ) regulates angiogenic response , but its roles in diabetic retinopathy remain unclear . In this work , diabetes mellitus was induced in rats by streptozotocin . ITGA5 interference was achieved by intravitreal delivery of adeno associated virus . Upregulation of ITGA5 was found in diabetic rat retinal tissues . ITGA5 knockdown decreased the neovascularization , acellular capillary formation , and pericytes . The protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGFA ) , vascular adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM 1 ) , and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM 1 ) was reduced after ITGA5 interference . Besides , ITGA5 knockdown decreased the phosphorylation level of FAK , TAK 1 , and p In vitro , rat retinal microvascular endothelial cells ( RRMECs ) were cultured under high glucose condition to stimulate diabetic environment . ITGA5 knockdown inhibited VEGFA secretion , tube formation , cell invasion , and migration . Upregulation of VCAM 1 and ICAM 1 that induced by high glucose was reversed by ITGA5 silencing . ITGA5 knockdown blocked the activation of TAK 1/NF kB pathway in RRMECs . Additionally , in oxygen induced retinopathy model , ITGA5 interference inhibited pathological neovascularization . These results demonstrate that ITGA5 contributes to the angiogenesis in diabetic retinopathy by activating TAK 1/NF kB pathway .
The medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) is important for higher cognitive functions , including working memory , decision making , and emotional control . In vivo recordings of neuronal activity in the mPFC have been achieved via invasive electrical and optical approaches . Here we apply low invasive three photon in vivo imaging in the mPFC of the mouse at unprecedented depth . Specifically , we measure neuronal and astrocytic Ca ( 2+ ) transient parameters in awake head fixed mice up to a depth of 1700 microm . Furthermore , we longitudinally record dendritic spine density ( 41 +/ 07 microm ( 1 ) ) deeper than 1 mm for a week . Using 1650 nm wavelength to excite red fluorescent microglia , we quantify their processes ' motility ( 9 +/ 2% turnover rate ) at previously unreachable depths ( 1100 microm ) . We establish three photon imaging of the mPFC enabling neuronal and glial recordings with subcellular resolution that will pave the way for novel discoveries in this brain region .
Diabetic wounds are common in patients with type 2 diabetes ; they are ischemic and inflammatory , and difficult to heal without intervention . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) is a standard treatment , but its effectiveness is limited to a subset of the aging population . Senescent fibroblasts , a hallmark of aging , impair wound healing , and senolytic drugs , like quercetin ( Q ) , which target senescent cells , may improve healing . In this study , we developed a mathematical model that defines biological aging through two parameters , eta and [Formula : see text] , that decline with age . These parameters reflect the biological age of an individual , where eta represents fibroblast proliferation and [Formula : see text] represents the production of the angiogenetic protein VEGF . Our model predicts that treatment with only HBOT achieves wound closure , within normal expectable time , for patients with a limited subset pairs of [Formula : see text] , and this subset is increased to a larger subset by combining Q with HBOT . The two subsets of [Formula : see text] are determined explicitly by simulations of the model . To make these results applicable in clinical setting , one will have to relate the aging parameters eta and [Formula : see text] to tangible marks of biological aging factors .
The human relaxin family peptide receptors RXFP3 and RXFP4 play important physiological roles through interactions with endogenous hormones , relaxin 3 and insulin like peptide 5 ( INSL5 ) . They are implicated in certain neurological and metabolic disorders . While INSL5 only activates RXFP4 , relaxin 3 is recognized by both receptors . Here , we report the cryo electron microscopy structures of RXFP3 G ( i ) complexes bound by relaxin 3 or a small molecule dual agonist ( compound 4 ) , and relaxin 3 in complex with RXFP4 G ( i ) , with global resolutions of 91 A , 95 A , and 10 A , respectively . It is found that relaxin 3 adopts a conserved binding conformation within the transmembrane domain ( TMD ) bundle of RXFP3 and RXFP4 , where the C terminal tip residues of its B chain , R26 and W27 , make extensive contacts with conserved receptor residues , thereby activating RXFP3 and RXFP Compound 4 mimics these key interactions by binding to both receptors . In contrast , the C terminal residues composition and TMD binding angle of INSL5 in RXFP4 differ significantly from that of relaxin 3 , ensuring its selectivity for RXFP These findings deepen our understanding about the structural basis of ligand recognition and selectivity in this G protein coupled receptor subfamily .
Organic farming could be a promising approach as an agricultural system utilizing available organic materials without retrogradation natural resources . In this study , the effect of four levels of compost ( 0 , 12 , 18 , and 24 t/ha ) on fenugreek plants ( Trigoneila foenum greecum ) over two seasons ( 2021 2022 and 2022 2023 ) was investigated in combination with different planting timings on a sandy soil . A randomized complete block design with three replications was used for the experiment conducted at the Agricultural Experiment and Research Centre of Minia University , Egypt . The Results showed that fertilizing fenugreek plants with compost significantly increased the vegetative growth traits such as plant height , number of branches/plants and herb biomass . The highest values of soil organic carbon ( SOC ) , 3 mg kg ( 1 ) , dissolved organic carbon ( DOC ) , l6 mg kg ( 1 ) , dissolved organic nitrogen ( DON ) , 43 mg kg ( 1 ) , microbial biomass C ( 67 mg kg ( 1 ) . ) , N ( 88 mg kg ( 1 ) ) , P ( 67 mg kg ( 1 ) ) , net bacterial [3 ( x10 cfu g ( 1 ) ) ] and fungi [32 ( x10 cfu g ( 1 ) ) ] counts were obtained with 24t/ha of compost . Enzyme activities of dehydrogenase ( DH ) , urease and beta glucosidase ( betaG ) increased significantly as the compost rate increased . For planting dates , the beginning of October was the optimal time for fenugreek production in April . For sandy soils with low fertility under arid conditions , organic and inorganic fertilizer use will enhance crop quality and productivity , soil health and soil organic matter build up .
The prevalence of concomitant metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease ( MAFLD ) in patients with hepatitis B virus associated hepatocellular carcinoma ( HBV HCC ) is increasing , though the relationship between MAFLD and HBV HCC remains unclear . The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical impact of MAFLD on survival outcomes in patients with HBV HCC after radical resection . Patients with HBV HCC who underwent radical resection consecutively from January 2015 to December 2020 were included . The retrospective analysis focused on the correlation between histologically confirmed concomitant MAFLD and clinical outcomes . Among the 843 patients with HBV HCC who underwent radical resection , concomitant MAFLD was observed in 172 ( 4% ) patients . In comparison to the non MAFLD group , the MAFLD group did not have a significant impact on recurrence free survival ( RFS ) or overall survival ( OS ) rates at 1 , 3 , and 5 years ( all P > 05 ) . However , subgroup analysis revealed significantly lower 1 , 3 , and 5 year rates of RFS and OS in the diabetic MAFLD group compared to the non diabetic MAFLD group ( all P < 05 ) . Moreover , diabetic MAFLD was an independent risk factor associated with poorer OS after radical resection ( HR , 444 ; 95% CI 082 331 , P = 032 ) . Concomitant diabetic MAFLD is associated with a poor prognosis after radical resection in patients with HBV HCC .
OBJECTIVE : This bibliometric study aimed to map the global research landscape of programmed cell death ( PCD ) in renal cancer , delineating publication trends , influential authors , contributing regions , and thematic shifts between 1998 and 2023 year . METHODS : We retrieved 5 , 134 records from the Web of Science Core Collection ( 1998 2023 ) using comprehensive keywords encompassing " renal cancer , " " programmed cell death , " and related synonyms . After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria , we conducted co citation , keyword , and cluster analyses with CiteSpace ( v . R2 ) and VOSviewer ( v . 20 ) to identify major research fronts , collaboration networks , and thematic clusters . RESULTS : Findings revealed a progressive increase in publications , notably accelerating after 2010 in tandem with the rise of immunotherapeutic strategies and targeted molecular interventions . China and the United States emerged as leading contributors , while journals such as Cancer Research and Clinical Cancer Research dominated in both publication frequency and citation impact . Authors including Kwon Taeg Kyu and Dahiya Rajvir significantly shaped foundational apoptosis research . Keyword and cluster analyses demonstrated a shift from earlier apoptosis and angiogenesis focused studies toward intersections of metabolic reprogramming , immune infiltration , and newer cell death modalities ( e . g . , ferroptosis , pyroptosis ) . High impact papers underscored immunotherapy ' s pivotal role in modulating cell death pathways and informing novel combination regimens . CONCLUSION : PCD research in renal cancer has evolved into a dynamic , interdisciplinary domain integrating immunology , molecular targeting , and multi omic profiling . Future development of the field aimed at refining precision therapies that exploit diverse cell death mechanisms and thereby improve clinical outcomes .
Patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) were grouped into subtypes by a symptom based diagnostic system of the traditional Chinese medicine for detecting metabolomic information that would otherwise be lost due to the high degree of variations in clinical samples . LC/MS based metabolomic tools were employed to identify distinct metabolomic features in T2DM patients in one of the subtypes in the symptom based diagnostic system . Several of the affected metabolic pathways could be ameliorated by the combined treatment of metformin and DPP4 inhibitor , except the taurine/hypotaurine metabolic pathway . It was possible that modulating the taurine/hypotaurine metabolism in the combined treatment with metformin and DPP4 inhibitor would enhance the therapeutic effects . To this end , a mouse diabetic model was treated with taurine in addition to metformin and DPP4 inhibitor . Indeed supplementing taurine during the combined treatment led to improvements in various indicators of the disorder such as those for the fatty acid and glucose metabolisms . It could be concluded that taurine was a useful supplement for treating T2DM with metformin and DPP4 inhibitor .
Ruthenium ( Ru ) nanoparticles were immobilized on the g CN surface ( Ru g CN ) , attaining lower potential electrochemiluminescence ( ECL ) emission of g CN and yielding an exceptional ECL signal . This enhancement was attributed to the formation of a Schottky barrier between Ru nanoparticles and g CN , which mitigated electrode passivation and provides catalytically active sites that facilitated the generation of SO ( ∙ ) electrogenerated by the coreactant KSO . At the same potential , luminol undergone an ECL reaction with the SO ( ∙ ) to generate luminol radicals , which can subsequently enter a competitive reaction with Ru g CN , significantly reducing the ECL intensity of Ru g CN . NH MIL 101 ( Fe ) was utilized to couple with luminol ( NH MIL 101 ( Fe ) @Luminol ) , which can further enhance the quenching efficiency . This design not only efficiently quench the ECL intensity of Ru g CN , but it could also be utilized for immobilizing the secondary antibody of heart type fatty acid binding protein ( H FABP ) which is a biomarker for acute myocardial infarction . By undergoing an immune reaction with the antigen H FABP , the labels ( Ab NH MIL 101 ( Fe ) @Luminol ) were immobilized onto the electrode surface , and their quantity on the electrode surface changes accordingly with variations in antigen concentrations . Based on this principle , a competitive ECL immunosensor was constructed for detecting H FABP . The range of detection extended from 0 fg mL ( 1 ) to 50 ng mL ( 1 ) , and a low detection limit of 43 fg mL ( 1 ) ( S/N = 3 ) were attained .
To examine changes in peripheral blood complete blood count ( CBC ) parameters during acute Kawasaki disease ( KD ) , compare immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) sensitive and IVIG resistant groups , and develop an IVIG resistance model . A retrospective review of clinical and lab data from 282 KD patients ( 2014 2024 ) was conducted . CBC parameters were collected at initial , pre IVIG , and post IVIG stages . The rank sum test assessed parameter differences over time . Patients were categorized into IVIG resistant ( n = 29 ) and IVIG sensitive ( n = 253 ) groups . Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified IVIG resistance risk factors , resulting in four predictive models ( A , B , C , and D ) based on blood changes and clinical experience . The models ' effectiveness was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves , the Hosmer Lemeshow test , and decision curve analysis , with the bootstrap ( BS ) method confirming performance . Significant differences were found in post IVIG blood parameters , including white blood cell count ( WBC ) , neutrophils , lymphocytes , eosinophils , hemoglobin , platelets , neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) , platelet to lymphocyte ratio ( PLR ) , and mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio ( MPVLR ) , compared to pre IVIG and initial CBC ( P < 05 ) . In IVIG resistant patients , NLR , PLR , MPVLR , neutrophil percentage were higher , while lymphocyte percentage was lower than in IVIG sensitive patients ( P < 05 ) . The resistant group also showed smaller changes in neutrophil percentages ( big up tri , openN ) and lymphocyte percentages ( big up tri , openL ) . Area under the curve ( AUC ) values for BS ROC curves were as follows : model A : 758 ( 95% CI : 636 878 ) , model B : 917 ( 95% CI : 852 982 ) , model C : 949 ( 95% CI : 909 978 ) , and model D ( NLR post IVIG administration combined with big up tri , openL ) : 910 ( 95% CI : 857 963 ) . Hosmer Lemeshow test P values for all four models were > DCA indicated clinical value for all models , especially model C . Blood routine parameters in children with KD vary over time , and IVIG administration alters these parameters . We developed and validated four prediction models for IVIG resistance in KD patients using blood routine data . This indicates that ongoing monitoring of these parameters can predict IVIG resistance and enhance patient outcomes .
An electrochemiluminescence ( ECL ) fluorescence ( FL ) dual mode aptasensing system is proposed for estradiol detection . Firstly , ruthenium based metal organic framework nanosheets ( RuMOFNSs ) were synthesized by a simple one pot method . RuMOFNSs exhibited both fluorescence ( FL ) and electrochemiluminescence ( ECL ) characteristics . After RuMOFNSs were immobilized on the electrode , complementary target DNA ( cDNA ) , gold nanoclusters labeled aptamer ( AuNCs Apt ) were successively assembled on the electrode to fabricate the aptasensor . The absorption spectrum of RuMOFNSs could be well overlapped with the fluorescence emission spectrum ( or ECL spectrum ) of AuNCs . When estradiol was absent , AuNCs Apt hybridizes with cDNA to form double stranded DNA . The close proximity between AuNCs and RuMOFNSs led to the efficient resonance energy transfer ( RET ) from AuNCs ( donor ) to RuMOFNSs ( acceptor ) , thus the enhanced ECL ( or FL ) signals were achieved . In the presence of estradiol , the high affinity between Apt and estradiol led to the dissociation of double stranded DNA ; the increased distance between AuNCs and RuMOFNSs hindered the RET , and the decreased ECL ( or FL ) signals were obtained . The aptasensor demonstrates exceptional sensitivity for detecting estradiol , with FL and ECL detection limits of 97 pM and 20 fM , respectively . This innovative approach offers significant potential for endocrine disrupting chemical determination .
Venous malformations ( VMs ) are vascular anomalies lacking curative treatments , often caused by somatic PIK3CA mutations that hyperactivate the PI3Kalpha AKT mTOR signaling pathway . Here , we identify a venous specific signaling circuit driving disease progression , where excessive PI3Kalpha activity amplifies upstream TIE2 receptor signaling through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms . In Pik3ca ( H1047R ) driven VM mouse models , single cell transcriptomics and lineage tracking revealed clonal expansion of mutant endothelial cells with a post capillary venous phenotype , characterized by suppression of the AKT inhibited FOXO1 and its target genes , including the TIE2 antagonist ANGPT An imbalance in TIE2 ligands , likely exacerbated by aberrant recruitment of smooth muscle cells producing the agonist ANGPT1 , increased TIE2 activity in both mouse and human VMs . While mTOR blockade had limited effects on advanced VMs in mice , inhibiting TIE2 or ANGPT effectively suppressed their growth . These findings uncover a PI3K FOXO1 ANGPT TIE2 circuit as a core driver of PIK3CA related VMs and highlight TIE2 as a promising therapeutic target .
Neuronal ferroptosis plays a vital role in the progression of neonatal hypoxic ischemic brain damage ( HIBD ) . M2 type microglia derived exosomes ( M2 exos ) have been shown to protect neurons from ischemia reperfusion ( I/R ) brain injury , but their impact on I/R induced neuronal ferroptosis and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood . In this study , we used an in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation ( OGD/R ) model in HT 22 neuronal cells to investigate how M2 exos modulate ferroptosis . We found that M2 exos were internalized by HT 22 cells and significantly attenuated OGD/R induced ferroptosis . Mechanistically , M2 exos enhanced mitophagy , which was mediated by the upregulation of FUN14 domain containing protein 1 ( FUNDC1 ) , thereby inhibiting ferroptosis . Further analysis revealed that M2 exos activated FUNDC1 dependent mitophagy through the AMP activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) /UNC 51 like kinase 1 ( ULK1 ) signaling pathway . Taken together , these findings suggest that M2 exos ameliorate I/R induced neuronal ferroptosis by enhancing FUNDC1 mediated mitophagy through the activation of AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway .
Agouti Related Peptide ( AgRP ) neurons are located in the hypothalamus , and upon stimulation , these neurons regulate hunger and hunger mediated behaviors , especially food seeking and compulsive eating . AgRP neurons are naturally activated by ghrelin binding onto the ghrelin receptors on the neuron surface during starvation or fasting state to evoke the aforementioned behaviors . In this study , we used channelrhodopsin ( ChR2 ) , an optogenetic actuator , to control AgRP neuronal activity . For the first time , we observed food intake behavior in zebrafish larvae by optogenetically triggering AgRP1 neurons . We created a transgenic line , Tg ( AgRP1 : ChR2 Kaede ) , where ChR2 Kaede is expressed in AgRP1 neurons . Transgenic zebrafish Tg ( AgRP1 : ChR2 Kaede ) larvae at 6 days post fertilization and wild type ( ABWT ) larvae were used to compare the suction behavior . We found that AgRP1 neuron activation in transgenic larvae led to a significantly higher food consumption behavior than wildtype larvae when analyzed using Particle Image Velocimetry ( PIV ) to calculate the food particle velocity initiated by larval suction behavior . These findings in this novel transgenic zebrafish model would be useful in studying various hunger related behaviors , their underlying neural circuits , and substrates subjected to different chemical stimuli , including drugs of abuse .

Drug resistance develops frequently after colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) surgery , indicating the urgent need for new therapeutic strategies . Taletrectinib ( DS 6051b/AB 106 ) , a synthetic ROS1/NTRK inhibitor which has shown meaningful antitumor activity , is currently undergoing clinical trials aimed at addressing targeted resistance . However , the anti cancer effect of taletrectinib on CRC remains unclear . In this study , our purpose was to evaluate taletrectinib related cytotoxicity in vitro using two CRC cell lines , as well as in vivo in a mouse tumor model . The mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity of taletrectinib was evaluated using light microscopy , scanning electron microscopy , immunofluorescence assays , an annexin V FITC/propidium iodide detection , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) release assays , and western blotting . We found that the viability of CRC cells decreased with increasing concentrations of taletrectinib . In addition , transcriptome sequencing indicated that HCT116 and LOVO cell lines did not carry ROS1 or NTRK related gene fusions and that the cytotoxic effect of taletrectinib was exerted via caspase 3/gasdermin E ( GSDME ) dependent pyroptosis . Moreover , the effect of taletrectinib in promoting pyroptosis was reversed by treatment with the SRC agonist , tolimidone , both in vitro and in vivo . Overall , our findings suggest that taletrectinib suppresses tumor growth by inducing GSDME mediated pyroptosis via the SRC/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway , indicating that taletrectinib shows potential as a promising therapeutic agent against CRC .
Antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) imperils global public health overlooking the epidemiological situation of community acquired infections , especially in low and middle income countries . We conducted this study in a suburban community in West Bengal , India , to comprehend the AMR and bacterial forensics of Escherichia coli causing community acquired urinary tract infections ( CAUTIs ) . Antibiograms , beta lactamases , plasmid mediated quinolone resistance genes , and plasmids were investigated to explore AMR . Bacterial forensics was assessed using phylogrouping , genetic fingerprinting , and strain typing . Antibiograms revealed that > 75% of isolates had a multiple antibiotic resistance ( MAR ) index of > Fosfomycin remained 100% effective as an empiric drug , followed by nitrofurantoin ( > 75% ) , aminoglycosides ( > 65% ) , and co trimoxazole ( > 50% ) . Multidrug resistant ( MDR ) was frequent ( > 75% ) , with < 5% being extensively drug resistant , including two colistin resistant isolates . Piperacillin/tazobactam showed promising activity against the ESBL producing isolates ( > 70% ) mostly carrying CTX M 15 and TEM 1 ( > 50% ) , which declined in the presence of OXA 1 ( > 20% ) . TEM 253 and 254 , two novel alleles , were assigned . Two of the thirteen NDM 5 producing carbapenem resistant isolates co harbored OXA Among fluoroquinolone resistant isolates ( > 80% ) , aac ( 6 ' ) lb cr ( > 20% ) was the most common , followed by qnrS ( > 10% ) . Plasmid of > 212 kb was prevalent ( > 60% ) , especially in MDR isolates . IncF was the sole plasmid in > 85% of isolates , with > 90% having a MAR index > Phylogroup B2 was prevalent ( > 35% ) , primarily associated with the ESBL producing ST131 clone ( > 80% ) . Carbapenem resistant isolates belonged to phylogroup A/sequence type361 , C/ST2851 , D/ST405 , and F/ST ESBL producing isolates were largely clonally related . This maiden molecular study reveals the infiltration of MDR epidemic clones in a suburban community in eastern India , guiding genomic surveillance for strategic management of AMR at the national level .
Fermented foods and beverages , produced by the intentional growth of microorganisms , have long been among the most widely consumed foods in the human diet . Whether microorganisms are added directly to food substrates , or the growth and activity of autochthonous microorganisms colonizing food substrates is encouraged by selective conditions , the production of organic acids , ethanol and other metabolic end products enhance the safety , shelf life , sensory and functional properties of foods . Whereas some fermented foods may be produced by communities dominated by only a few taxa of limited phylogenetic diversity , others are produced through the concerted action of diverse microbial communities . In this Review , we describe the ecological interactions shaping microbial community structure and function across various categories of fermented foods by providing specific examples . We also describe how the manufacture , quality and sustainability of even traditional fermented foods can be improved by contemporary technologies . Finally , we briefly discuss current research on the ecological impact of microorganisms found in fermented food on the human gut .
Intestinal fibrosis represents a clinically intractable complication in colitis management . This study elucidates the regulatory mechanisms by which bone mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes ( BMSC Exo ) modulate the myofibroblastic transdifferentiation of intestinal fibroblast . BMSC Exo was isolated and characterized . RNA sequencing was performed on TGF beta activated CCD 18Co fibroblasts following BMSC Exo intervention . Histopathology , immunoblotting , migration assays , and imaging techniques ( immunofluorescence/immunohistochemistry ) were employed to quantify extracellular matrix ( ECM ) deposition and fibrotic responses in both in vitro and murine models . Human colonic specimens from Crohn ' s disease ( CD ) patients with structuring complications were analyzed for fibrotic components . BMSC Exo was successfully isolated . BMSC Exo treatment significantly attenuated fibroblast activation and migratory capacity , concomitant with downregulating collagen I and N cadherin expression . In vivo , histological fibrosis score , collagen deposition , and alpha SMA expression were significantly decreased after BMSC Exo administration . Transcriptomic profiling revealed significant enrichment of ECM remodeling pathways following BMSC Exo intervention , with connective tissue growth factor ( CCN2 ) identified as a pivotal mediator . Functional validation through CCN2 overexpression demonstrated the mechanistic dependence of BMSC Exo ' s anti fibrotic effects on the CCN2 TGF beta axis . Clinical specimens revealed a marked increase in collagen fiber deposition and co upregulation of CCN2 in stenotic CD tissues compared to non strictured regions . BMSC Exo exerts potent anti fibrotic effects through the suppression of fibroblast differentiation , mediated by targeted inhibition of the CCN2 TGF beta signaling nexus . These findings establish exosome based therapy as a novel therapeutic strategy for intestinal fibrosis .
We investigated the relationship between prefrontal functional connectivity of oxyhemoglobin and outcomes in sepsis associated encephalopathy ( SAE ) . Additionally , we developed a prognostic method for patients with SAE . A total of 40 consecutive patients with SAE were prospectively included . Cerebral oxyhemoglobin data were obtained using functional near infrared spectroscopy . Functional connectivity such as density was evaluated as the strength of the temporal correlation between channels based on Pearson ' s correlation coefficient of oxyhemoglobin . We obtained clinical information and evaluated severity scores using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) III . Outcomes were evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) at discharge . Patients were categorized into two groups : good outcome ( mRS 0 3 ) , and poor outcome ( mRS 4 6 ) . Among the patients with SAE , 17 ( 5% ) had good outcomes . Regarding connectivity analysis , density values were significantly higher in good outcome groups at all threshold values . The developed predictive method of good outcomes using the density value at a threshold of 6 and the APACHE III score showed very good predictive power ( area under the curve 951 [95% confidence interval 893 00] ) . This method had better discrimination powers for predicting outcome than density had at 6 ( 716 [557 876] ; P = 04 ) or the APACHE III score had alone ( 857 [735 979] ; P = 09 ) . A higher functional connectivity value of oxyhemoglobin in the prefrontal connectivity analysis was associated with good outcomes in SAE . Functional connectivity analysis of the prefrontal cortex and sepsis severity may help predict the prognosis in SAE patients .
This study explored the in vitro alleviation of the soluble and non digestible Chinese yam polysaccharides ( YP ) with covalent selenite grafting on the nonylphenol induced cytotoxicity and barrier damage in rat intestinal epithelial ( IEC 6 ) cells . Two grafted products YPSe I and particularly YPSe II possessed much higher Se contents than YP ( 803 and 486 versus 037 g/kg ) , could alleviate the cytotoxicity of nonylphenol by causing higher cell viability but lower lactate dehydrogenase release and ROS production , and were capable of repairing the induced barrier damage through increasing transepithelial electrical resistance , reducing paracellular permeability , promoting the production and distribution of cytoskeleton F actin , and up regulating the expression levels of three tight junction proteins namely zonula occludens 1 , occludin , and claudin Meanwhile , the expression levels of two proteins namely p p38 and p JNK in the cells , which are crucial to the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway , were up regulated by nonylphenol but down regulated by YPSe I and YPSe II . The results consistently confirmed that YP and YPSe II exhibited the respective lowest and highest activities in the cells to alleviate the nonylphenol induced cytotoxicity and barrier damage , declaring that both YP selenization and higher selenite grafting extent were the critical factors controlling the measured activities of YPSe I and YPSe II . Collectively , this selenite grafting of YP endowed the selenized products with higher activity in the cells to reduce nonylphenol induced cytotoxicity , especially to alleviate the induced barrier damage by inactivating the MAPK signaling pathway .
Sexual dimorphism plays a critical role in disease pathophysiology , but the subtlety and complexity of these differences , along with a lack of precise comparative methods , hinder the advancement of precision medicine and drug development . This limitation is particularly evident in metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease ( MASLD ) , where sex specific molecular mechanisms remain insufficiently understood . To address this gap , we employed an advanced integrative N glycoproteomics and proteomics approach to systematically analyze sex biased molecular signatures in primary mouse hepatocytes ( PMHs ) under healthy and MASLD conditions . Our analysis identified 280 sex biased proteins and 39 sex biased N glycosites , and KEGG enrichment revealed that female biased molecules were primarily involved in lipid metabolism , while male biased molecules were associated with inflammation and cytoskeletal remodeling . A combined dataset of 302 sex biased molecules was further analyzed using protein protein interaction ( PPI ) analysis and Rc value calculations , resulting in the identification of 21 hub proteins and 2 hub N glycosites as MASLD associated sex biased signatures . Notably , MASLD amplified proteomic sex differences while attenuating them in N glycosylation . Western blot validation of key signatures , including female biased MVK and male biased LGALS3 , highlighted distinct molecular adaptations between the sexes in MASLD progression . Our study introduced an advanced analytical framework for high resolution comparative molecular profiling by integrating N glycoproteomics with proteomics , providing valuable insights into sex biased molecular signatures , enhancing preclinical model development , and advancing sex specific therapeutic strategies in MASLD research and broader biological systems .
Far ultraviolet C ( Far UVC ) radiation , with a wavelength range from 200 to 235 nm , is germicidal and holds potential for clinical applications . However , its use against deep seated and internal infections , such as those affecting the lungs , remains less well established . The safety profile of Far UVC irradiation requires further investigation across different human tissues . In this study , we utilised a krypton chloride excimer lamp and a pulsed laser system to examine the effects of Far UVC irradiation on human lung cells in vitro and primary human tracheal tissue . Primary human tracheal tissue and cells exposed to continuous wave ( 222 nm ) and pulsed 206 nm and 222 nm light at doses of 5 , 25 , and 50 mJ/cm exhibited DNA damage , including phosphorylation of gammaH2AX ( Ser139 ) . The continuous wave and pulsed 222 nm irradiation caused the formation of pyrimidine pyrimidone ( 6 4 ) photoproducts . Irradiated human lung cells demonstrated reduced viability in vitro , and increased lactate dehydrogenase release into the culture medium 48 h post irradiation . Our findings reveal that even low doses of Far UVC ( 206 nm , 222 nm ) light can penetrate monolayers of human lung epithelial cells , causing direct DNA damage in the form of ( 6 4 ) photoproducts and DNA double strand breaks , ultimately leading to cell death .
Mesh adhesion is an important complication in prosthetic hernia repairs which may lead to intestinal obstruction , enterocutaneous fistula and viscus perforation . Therefore , direct contact between visceral organs and mesh should be avoided . The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of platelet rich fibrin ( PRF ) as an adhesion barrier . Thirty six Wistar Albino rats were used in the study . Four rats were used to obtain platelet rich fibrin . Remaining rats were divided to four separate groups . In sham group , abdominal wall was repaired by suture without mesh following laparotomy . Abdominal walls of remaining rats were excised for about 2 cm in length with margins 2 cm wide . The defect was repaired with polypropylene mesh , Parietex composite mesh , or PRF coated polypropylene mesh in three separate groups . Rats were sacrificed on the 14th postoperative day . Macroscopic Zuhlke and Greca adhesion scores , histopathological fibrosis grading and multinucleated giant cells were evaluated . There was statistically significant difference of adhesion scores of Zuhlke ( p = 013 ) and Greca ( p < 001 ) between all groups . It was observed that the adhesion score in the platelet rich fibrin group was lower than the polypropylene mesh group ( p = 003 ) , and there was no significant difference between the composite mesh group and the PRF group ( p = 13 ) . Fibroblast density and degree of fibrosis were higher in the platelet rich fibrin group than in the polypropylene group ( p < 001 ) , but there was no significant difference with the composite mesh group . Giant cell formation , an indicator of inflammation , was significantly higher in the platelet rich fibrin group than in the polypropylene mesh group ( p = 001 ) , and it was significantly less than in the composite mesh group ( p = 007 ) . Platelet rich fibrin significantly reduces the incidence of adhesion to polypropylene meshes in the early postoperative period and enhances fibrosis at the mesh abdominal wall interface . Acting as a biological barrier , platelet rich fibrin shows potential as an alternative to composite meshes and antiadhesive barriers .
Hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) , a neuropsychiatric complication secondary to liver cirrhosis and hepatic failure , represents the leading cause of mortality in end stage liver disease . While hyperammonemia remains the central pathogenic factor in HE progression , emerging evidence implicates oxidative stress , neuroinflammation , and neuronal apoptosis as critical synergistic contributors to HE pathogenesis . Hydrogen rich water , known for its antioxidant , anti inflammatory , and anti apoptotic properties , has not been systematically investigated for therapeutic efficacy in HE management . In the current investigation , we successfully established a HE rat model by administering thioacetamide via intraperitoneal injection . By observing the general state and behavioral changes of the rats , detecting liver function and blood ammonia , and observing the pathological changes of liver and brain tissue , it was discussed whether hydrogen rich water had a preventive and therapeutic effect on hepatic encephalopathy . Oxidative stress , inflammation and neuronal apoptosis were detected in plasma , prefrontal cortex and hippocampus to explore the possible mechanism of its protective effect . The results showed that hydrogen rich water can improve the behavioral changes of the HE rats , reduce blood ammonia , reduce liver function damage , alleviate the pathological changes of liver and brain tissue , significantly inhibit the systemic and local oxidative stress and inflammation of the brain tissue of the HE rats , and reduce neuronal apoptosis . In summary , hydrogen rich water might stabilize liver brain disturbance in thioacetamide induced HE rats by anti inflammation , anti oxidative stress and reducing neuronal apoptosis .
The coating of microbiota by secretory immunoglobulins ( sIgs ) determines which bacteria colonize the gut and influences bacterial metabolism . Previous work has identified sIgA and sIgT as mediators of gut homeostasis . However , sIgM coats a large proportion of the gut microbiota in humans and teleost fish , thus suggesting a conserved role of sIgM in microbiota homeostasis . Here , to investigate this hypothesis , we used the teleost rainbow trout as a model system . Depletion of IgM from trout resulted in severe microbiota dependent gut tissue damage , body weight loss , bacterial translocation and gut dysbiosis . IgM depletion led also to alterations in microbiota derived metabolites , including short chain fatty acids and essential amino acids . Supporting a protective role for sIgM in the gut , high mortality of IgM depleted fish occurred in an experimental colitis model as a result of severe systemic bacteraemia and septic shock . Our findings uncover sIgM as a previously unrecognized regulator of microbiota homeostasis and metabolism .
Degeneration of intervertebral discs is a significant factor in chronic lower back pain , impacting millions annually . Existing studies propose a potential link between lipids and disc disease , though causal relationships remain unclear . The objective of this study is to explore the causal connections between lipids , lower back pain , disc degeneration , and the risk of sciatica In this research , we utilized a comprehensive GWAS dataset encompassing 179 lipid traits to explore the causal connections between lipids and the susceptibility to conditions such as lower back pain ( LBP ) , intervertebral disc degeneration ( IVDD ) , and sciatica . To establish causality , we employed two sample Mendelian randomization , supplemented by Bayesian model averaging for verification . Our assessment of diversity and mutual influence involved Cochran ' s Q test , MR Egger intercept assessment , and MR PRESSO . Additionally , we performed a sensitivity analysis by systematically excluding individual elements to gauge their impact on outcomes in Mendelian randomization . Lastly , bidirectional Mendelian randomization was conducted to explore potential inverse associations between lipids and IVDD . Analyzing 179 lipidomic features as exposures and IVDD , LBP , and sciatica as outcomes , this study reveals significant causal relationships of glycerophospholipids , sterols , and glycerolipids with the risk of IVDD , LBP , and sciatica . Phosphatidylcholine , triglycerides , and sterols consistently exerted risk influences on IVDD , while phosphatidylethanolamine ( O 16 : 1_18 : 2 ) among glycerophospholipids exhibited a protective effect ( OR : 927 998 , P < 05 ) . Regarding LBP , sphingomyelin ( d38 : 2 ) in sphingolipids demonstrated a protective effect ( OR : 925 997 , P < 05 ) . For sciatica , triglycerides exhibited a risk influence , with varying effects observed for phosphatidylcholine and sterols with different molecular structures . Notably , sterol ester ( 27 : 1/16 : 1 ) consistently showed a risk effect across all three conditions . Our research provides valuable insights into how certain lipids are linked to the risks of LBP , IVDD , and sciatica . Our findings indicate that phosphatidylcholine and triglycerides may increase the incidence of IVDD , LBP , and sciatica , suggesting potential adverse effects . In contrast , sphingomyelin appears to reduce the occurrence of LBP and sciatica , indicating a protective role . Sterol esters also show a protective effect against sciatica ; however , the sterol ester ( 27 : 1/16 : 1 ) consistently demonstrates a detrimental impact on IVDD , LBP , and sciatica . Additionally , our study underscores the intricate nature of lipid metabolism concerning IVDD , LBP , and sciatica . It uncovers a range of structural variations among lipids and explores how these variations may lead to different effects across various molecular subtypes .
Radio resistance of cancer stem like cells ( CSCs ) is associated with the failure of radiation therapy . ZsGreen1 positive ( ZsG ( + ) ) cells , which exhibit low proteasome activity , have been used to enable the detection and isolation of CSCs . However , the mechanisms of radio resistance in canine tumor cells with low proteasome activity remain unclear . This study aimed to elucidate the radio resistance mechanisms of ZsG ( + ) cells by identifying a potential target of canine CSCs . ZsG ( + ) cells , isolated using flow cytometric cell sorting , were compared with ZsG ( ) cells . Sulfasalazine was used to suppress glutathione ( GSH ) synthesis by inhibiting xCT . In vitro experiments demonstrated a significantly higher radio resistance in ZsG ( + ) cells than in ZsG ( ) cells . After X irradiation , ZsG ( + ) cells had fewer p53‑binding protein 1 ( 53BP1 ) foci , low reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) accumulation , and high GSH content . Sulfasalazine caused radiosensitization of ZsG ( + ) cells with an increased number of 53BP1 foci by decreasing GSH contents and increasing ROS accumulation . The low proteasome activity played a role in xCT upregulation . In conclusion , canine tumor cells with low proteasome activity are radio resistant due to high GSH content and low ROS accumulation . Sulfasalazine causes radiosensitization of the tumor cells by altering redox balance by inhibiting GSH synthesis for effective targeting of canine CSCs .
Declining soil fertility due to unstable cultivation practices is a major challenge , particularly under water limited conditions , leading to reduced crop productivity . Identifying sustainable soil amendments that enhance plant resilience and improve soil properties is crucial for ensuring food security in arid and semi arid regions . Among these , activated acacia biochar has shown potential in improving soil quality . A pot scale experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of four different soil amendments i . e . , biochar amended soil ( BAS ) , vermicompost amended soil ( VCAS ) , perlite amended soil ( PAS ) , activated biochar amended soil ( ABAS ) on wheat physiology and yield under moisture stress conditions . Soil amendments were incorporated at 5% and 5% ( dry weight basis ) by through mixing . Two water regimes were applied from booting to grain filling : ( i ) optimal moisture ( 80% of field capacity , FC ) ( ii ) moisture stress ( 50% of FC ) . The highest improvement in water holding capacity was observed in soil amended with 5% ABAS which increased by 31% ( 3 +/ 72 ) compared to non amended soil ( NAS ) . Under 50% FC , plants grown in 5% and 5% ABAS exhibited significantly higher total chlorophyll content ( 11% ) , stomatal area ( 42% ) , stomatal aperture ( 29% ) , and guard cell area ( 44% ) than NAS . The maximum increase in photosynthetic rate ( threefold and 2 fold higher ) and transpiration rates ( threefold and 2 fold higher ) were observed in plants of 5% BAS and 5% ABAS , respectively than NAS . However , the highest improvement in water use efficiency ( 52% ) was observed in the plants of 5% ABAS than NAS . Leaf nutrient assessment showed a 4% and 6 fold increase in percent weight of carbon and phosphorus in the plants of BAS , 75% higher sodium in PAS , 139% higher calcium in VCAS , and 5% higher nitrogen and 58% higher magnesium in ABAS than NAS . Additionally , the highest accumulation of metabolites including amides , polysaccharides , lignin and waxes , was recorded in plants grown in amended soil , particularly in ABAS . Regarding yield attributes , plants grown in 5% and 5% ABAS had significantly ( p < 05 ) higher leaf area ( 84 85% ) , spike length ( 89 93% ) , spikelet per spike ( 139 166% ) , and 1000 grain weight ( 133 157% ) under 50% FC compared to NAS . In conclusion , activated biochar considerably enhances plant physio biochemical attributes and yield under water stress conditions . Its applications may be recommended for farmers in arid regions to mitigate the adverse effects of water scarcity .
Fibrosis is involved in 45% of deaths in the United States , and no treatment exists to reverse progression of the disease . To find novel targets for fibrosis therapeutics , we developed a model for the differentiation of monocytes to myofibroblasts that allowed us to screen for proteins involved in myofibroblast differentiation . Inhibition of a novel protein target generated by our model , talin2 , reduces myofibroblast specific morphology , alpha smooth muscle actin content , and collagen I content and lowers the pro fibrotic secretome of myofibroblasts . We find that knockdown of talin2 de differentiates myofibroblasts and reverses bleomycin induced lung fibrosis in mice , and further that Tln2 ( / ) mice are resistant to bleomycin induced lung fibrosis and resistant to unilateral ureteral obstruction induced kidney fibrosis . Talin2 inhibition is thus a potential treatment for reversing lung and kidney fibroses .
Analyze the correlation between the DNA methylation levels of Protocadherin 17 ( PCDH17 ) cg03865667 and rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , and evaluate its potential as a biomarker for diagnosing RA . Peripheral blood samples were collected from a cohort of 370 individuals , comprising patients diagnosed with RA , ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) , psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) , gout , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , dermatomyositis ( DM ) , primary Sjogren ' s syndrome ( SS ) , and healthy controls ( HC ) , for subsequent analysis . DNA methylation sequencing techniques were employed to evaluate the methylation levels of the PCDH17 cg03865667 locus . Relative to the HC , AS , and SS groups , PCDH17 cg03865667 was significantly downregulated in RA patients ( P = 0403 ; p = 0290 ; p = 044 ) . Compared to the HC group , the methylation levels at CpG sites 57 , 631 , 544 , 57 , 631 , 571 , and 57 , 631 , 581 were significantly downregulated in RA patients ( p = 0078 ; p = 0123 ; p = 0309 ) . For the TTCCTT and TTTCTT haplotypes , methylation levels were significantly lower in RA patients than in HC ( p = 0188 ; p = 0053 ) , particularly for the TTTCTT haplotype . Significant differences were observed between the CCP ( ) RF ( ) group , the CCP ( + ) / RF ( + ) group , and the HC group among the RA subgroups . No significant differences were found within the double positive subgroup . The average methylation level of PCDH17 was negatively correlated with C reactive protein ( CRP ) ( r= 28 , p = 9e 4 ) . This study indicates that PCDH17 cg03865667 methylation may function as a potential biomarker for RA diagnosis . The subgroup analysis suggests that it may serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosing RA , indicating a capacity to enhance the diagnostic accuracy for seronegative RA and reduce the likelihood of missed and incorrect diagnoses .
Previous studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between the Triglyceride Glucose Index ( TyG ) index and diabetes mellitus ; however , limited research has focused on the relationship between the TyG index and the incidence of diabetes mellitus in the Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatotic Liver Disease ( MASLD ) population . This study aims to investigate the association between the TyG index and the occurrence of diabetes mellitus in the MASLD population in Japan . This retrospective cohort study included 2 , 741 patients with MASLD from Murakami Memorial Hospital in Japan , spanning the years 2004 to The primary method employed to investigate the relationship between the TyG index and the occurrence of diabetes was Cox proportional hazards regression . Additionally , a Generalized Additive Model and a two piecewise linear regression model were utilized to assess whether a linear relationship exists between the TyG index and the development of diabetes , as well as to calculate threshold effects . After adjusting for variables that may potentially influence the occurrence of diabetes , we found that the TyG index was positively correlated with diabetes incidence ( HR = 43 , 95% CI : 03 , 98 ) in MASLD population overall . Further in depth analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship between the TyG index and the occurrence of diabetes . When the TyG index was less than 95 , it exhibited a negative correlation ( HR = 22 , 95% CI : 07 , 66 ) ; however , when the TyG index exceeded 95 , it showed a positive correlation ( HR = 68 , 95% CI : 20 , 36 ) . Additionally , we conducted a subject working curve analysis on the TyG index and the two components used to calculate it , fasting blood glucose and triglycerides , and found that the TyG index demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity in predicting the occurrence of diabetes in the MASLD population . TyG index exhibits a nonlinear relationship with the incidence of diabetes in the MASLD population , and its sensitivity and specificity are superior to those of fasting blood glucose and triglycerides .
Four novel bacterial strains isolated from agricultural soil were tested for their ability to degrade the persistent herbicide diflufenican , in a mineral medium and soil . The presence of three potential diflufenican metabolites , 2 , 4 difluoroaniline , 2 ( 3 trifluoromethylphenoxy ) nicotinamide , and 2 ( 3 trifluoromethylphenoxy ) nicotinic acid , was analysed . The isolated bacterial species were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Pseudomonas sp . 10Kp8 A1 , Pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp . aureofaciens strain B19 A2 , Pseudomonas baetica strain JZY4 9 C1 , and Streptomyces atratus strain ROA017 D The effect of each isolate and its consortia on diflufenican degradation was compared to control samples without microorganisms . In the mineral salt medium ( MSM ) and soil , strain D1 showed the highest degradation , reaching 1% and 79% , respectively . However , the application of a synthetic consortium of four microorganisms resulted in even higher degradation in both environments , achieving 4% and 2% in the liquid medium and the soil , respectively . Notably , the microorganisms were able to grow in MSM containing diflufenican at concentrations of 60 220 mg/kg , utilizing it as a source of carbon and energy . The quadruple synthetic consortium holds promise as a bioremediation technique for reducing the contamination of ecosystems by this persistent herbicide . These findings demonstrate the diversity of diflufenican degrading bacteria in agricultural soil ecosystems and provide a promising new approach for bioremediation of diflufenican and other persistent herbicides in the agricultural soil .
Plasma mediated bacterial inactivation holds great promise but presents several challenges . This study investigates the antibacterial effect of 45 GHz non thermal microwave ( MW ) plasma on Staphylococcus aureus ( S . aureus ) and Salmonella abony ( S . abony ) suspended in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) . A 6 log reduction in both bacterial strains was achieved within 300 s of plasma exposure . The enhanced inactivation is attributed to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , particularly ( . ) OH ( 30% in S . aureus , 13% in S . abony ) and HO ( 27% in S . aureus , and 84% in S . abony ) , which caused oxidative stress and membrane depolarization , detected via fluorescence spectrofluorometry . Morphological changes were confirmed through field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE SEM ) . Membrane impairment led to leakage of intracellular contents such as proteins , lipids , and nucleic acids . DNA damage was evident from hyperchromic effects observed at 260 nm . Confocal microscopy revealed a qualitative increase in red fluorescent ( dead ) cells with longer exposure . Flow cytometry further quantified the dead cells at 88% in S . aureus and 95% in S . abony . These findings provide comprehensive insight into the bacterial inactivation mechanism and demonstrate the strong potential of non thermal MW plasma for applications in sterilization , infection control , and food safety .
CRISPR Cas systems are small RNA guided immune systems in prokaryotes . CRISPR RNA ( crRNA ) provides sequence specificity and programmability , guiding the effector complex to cleave target nucleic acids . Cas6 family ribonucleases can cleave precursor crRNA to generate functional crRNAs in most type I and type III CRISPR Cas systems . Most existing studies of Cas6 functions are mainly focused on nuclease activity in vitro and Cas6 processed product characterization in vivo . However , in hosts harboring multiple CRISPR systems , the biological functions of the co occurrence of various Cas6 proteins and their cross cleavage activity toward different types of crRNAs remain largely unexplored . In this study , we biochemically characterized the cross cleavage activity of two Cas6 proteins in Thermus thermophilus HB27 and first found that Cas6 could anchor the mature crRNA and interact with Cas5 subunit of type I B system , revealing the functions of Cas6 to mediate the assembly of type I Cascade complex . We further demonstrated that the type III associated Cas6 protein could act as a negative regulator by competing with the I B Cas6 protein during the assembly of type I B Cascade complex , significantly suppressing the interference activity of type I B system . Our findings provide an insight into the functional coupling and regulation mechanisms underlying multiple CRISPR Cas systems .
The tumorigenesis of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors ( siNETs ) is not understood and comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic data sets are limited . Therefore , we performed whole genome and transcriptome analysis of 39 well differentiated siNET samples . Our genomic data revealed a lack of recurrent driver mutations and demonstrated that multifocal siNETs from individual patients can arise genetically independently . We detected germline mutations in Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway ( FANC ) genes , involved in homologous recombination ( HR ) DNA repair , in 9% of patients and found mutational signatures of defective HR DNA repair in late stage tumor evolution . Furthermore , transcriptomic analysis revealed low expression of the transcriptional repressor REST . Summarizing , we identify a novel common transcriptomic signature of siNETs and demonstrate that genomic alterations alone do not explain initial tumor formation , while impaired DNA repair likely contributes to tumor evolution and represents a potential pharmaceutical target in a subset of patients .
Bacterial cellulose is an engineered living material which holds significant potential due to its material properties and broad applicability across scientific and design disciplines . However , challenges in interdisciplinary collaboration , scalability and commercialization have slowed its widespread adoption and integration into industry applications such as fashion and textiles . This study addresses the gap in understanding how bacterial cellulose is perceived , developed , and utilized across scientific and design disciplines . Through 20 semi structured interviews with scientists and designers around the world , this paper explores the following themes : the human living material relationship spectrum , which highlights the distinct ways science and design stakeholders interact with bacterial cellulose as a living material ; perceptions of a living material made from bacteria ; and bacterial cellulose ' s potential as a programmable biomaterial . Additionally , we employ Bruno Latour ' s Actor Network Theory to map the complex network of human and non human actors shaping bacterial cellulose ' s trajectory , identifying critical factors such as consumer acceptance , interdisciplinary collaboration , and material culture . By bridging perspectives from science and design , this study offers actionable insights into bacterial cellulose ' s future as a sustainable and programmable engineered living material , guiding its responsible development and broader adoption across industries .
The expression of ubiquitin like molecule interferon stimulated gene 15 kDa ( ISG15 ) and its post translational modification ( ISGylation ) are significantly activated by interferons or pathogen infections , highlighting their roles in innate immune responses . Over 1100 proteins have been identified as ISGylated . ISG15 is removed from substrates by interferon induced ubiquitin specific peptidase 18 ( USP18 ) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 derived papain like protease . High ISGylation levels may help prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID 19 ) . Polyamines ( spermidine and spermine ) exhibit anti inflammatory , antioxidant , and mitochondrial functions . However , the relationship between nutrients and ISGylation remains unclear . This study assessed the effects of spermine and spermidine on ISGylation . MCF10A and A549 cells were treated with interferon alpha , spermine , or spermidine , and the expression levels of various proteins and ISGylation were measured . Spermine and spermidine dose dependently reduced ISGylation . Additionally , spermidine directly interacted with ISG15 and USP18 , enhancing their interaction and potentially reducing ISGylation . Therefore , spermidine may prevent ISGylation related immune responses .
Biallelic mutations in the DCPS gene disrupting the decapping activity of the scavenger decapping protein DcpS , leads to neurodevelopmental deficiencies and intellectual disability . However , the molecular basis for the neurogenesis defects in these individuals remains unknown . Here we show that cells derived from individuals with a DCPS mutation harbor a creatine deficiency and a corresponding elevation of the creatine precursor , guanidinoacetate ( GAA ) . The altered metabolite levels are a consequence of a reduction in both the mRNA and protein levels for the enzyme that converts GAA into creatine , guanidinoacetate methyltransferase . Importantly , the compromised neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth phenotypes observed during the differentiation of DcpS mutant patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells into neurons was reversed upon supplementation of creatine monohydrate . These findings suggest creatine deficiency as an underlying factor for the neurogenetic defect detected in DcpS mutant cells and a potential driver of the neurological deficiencies in affected individuals .
Rosacea is treated among others by doxycycline and sodium bituminosulfonate dry substance ( SBDS ) . We addressed the molecular mechanism ( s ) underlying the therapeutic benefit of SBDS and doxycycline . Therefore , we investigated whether SBDS or doxycycline regulates the expression of signal molecules relevant for inflammatory and angiogenic effects . Cyclooxygenase 1 ( COX1 ) and COX2 activity assays were assessed in primary human monocytes . The release of nitric oxide ( NO ) and their synthesizing enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , VEGF and LL37 release were determined in lung epithelial cells A549 , mast cells HMC 2 or in normal human epidermal keratinocytes ( NHEKs ) , respectively . The IC values of SBDS for the inhibition of recombinant human COX 1 and COX 2 were 9 and 3 microg/ml , respectively . In an inflammatory state ( COX 2 expression ) 100 microg/ml SBDS reduced PGE and TXB release in primary human monocytes . 25 microg/ml SBDS inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of iNOS . Moreover , 50 microg/ml SBDS and 30 microg/ml doxycycline inhibited the release of VEGF in an inflammatory state in HMC 2 cells . Both drugs did not affect LL37 release . Doxycycline did not affect intracellular NO levels and iNOS expression . SBDS and doxycycline mediate anti inflammatory and anti angiogenic effects through similar but also different signaling molecules .
Ambergris , a substance derived from the digestive system of sperm whales , has been valued for centuries for its unique aromatic properties . However , historical accounts indicate that certain human populations , particularly in East Asia , utilized ambergris without regard for its odor quality . These observations suggest that ambergris offers a model for studying how pleasant olfactory perception and its regional variations are constructed . Despite its historical and cultural significance , the molecular basis of ambergris perception has remained unclear . Here , we identified OR7A17 as an odorant receptor tuned to ( ) Ambroxide , a key odorant in ambergris . Analysis of genetic and functional variations in OR7A17 revealed that non functional alleles of this receptor are prevalent in human populations , especially in East Asia . Individuals lacking functional OR7A17 alleles could still detect ( ) Ambroxide but found its scent less pleasant compared to those with functional alleles . These findings elucidate a molecular mechanism that influences the perceived pleasantness of ambergris and shed light on its enduring legacy in perfumery .
Accurate prediction of prognosis and postoperative radiotherapy response is critical for personalized treatment in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . We developed a multimodal deep learning model ( MDLM ) integrating computed tomography , whole slide images , and clinical features from 1087 HNSCC patients across multiple centers . The MDLM exhibited good performance in predicting overall survival ( OS ) and disease free survival in external test cohorts . Additionally , the MDLM outperformed unimodal models . Patients with a high risk score who underwent postoperative radiotherapy exhibited prolonged OS compared to those who did not ( P = 016 ) , whereas no significant improvement in OS was observed among patients with a low risk score ( P = 898 ) . Biological exploration indicated that the model may be related to changes in the cytochrome P450 metabolic pathway , tumor microenvironment , and myeloid derived cell subpopulations . Overall , the MDLM effectively predicts prognosis and postoperative radiotherapy response , offering a promising tool for personalized HNSCC therapy .
Rooting is considered a critical stage in the micropropagation of Prunus sp . because it controls plant survival during acclimatization . Auxins and genotype are thought to play a significant role in root formation and induction . Therefore , the objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect of different indole 3 butyric acid ( IBA ) concentrations on the in vitro rooting and acclimatization of the Okinawa , Nemared , and Garnem peach rootstocks . Microcuttings of 2 3 cm in length were cultivated in MS medium supplemented with IBA ( 0 , 5 , 0 , 0 , 0 , and 0 mg L ( 1 ) ) for the in vitro rooting stage . According to our results , the Garnem genotype exhibited the highest in vitro rooting rate , number of roots per plantlet , and root length . The level of 0 mg L ( 1 ) of IBA was associated with rooting rates of 100% , 33% , and 75% for the Garnem , Okinawa , and Nemared , respectively . The Garnem genotype responded to 0 mg L ( 1 ) of IBA with a fixed highest root number ( 33 ) , which was the average number of roots per plantlet . Whereas , for the Nemared and Okinawa genotypes , the highest root number per plantlet was 00 and 00 , respectively , in response to 0 mg L ( 1 ) of IBA . The root lengths of the three genotypes varied significantly depending on the IBA treatment . The Garnem genotype presented the longest root length ( 33 cm ) , which was followed by the Okinawa genotype ( 49 cm ) , while the shortest value was presented with the Nemared ( 43 cm ) . The current study also demonstrated that the three genotypes developed abnormal roots and callus formation when the IBA concentration was increased to 00 mg L ( 1 ) . Following acclimatization , the Garnem , Okinawa , and Nemared genotypes had respective average survival rates of 93% , 90% , and 75% for plantlets with fully grown shoots and roots .
C reactive protein ( CRP ) is a well established marker of inflammation in neonates . Recent studies have shown the potential of CRP velocity as an early indicator of infection disorders in children and adults . However , data on CRP dynamics in the neonatal population remain limited . Our objective was to assess the dynamics of CRP levels and determine their clinical relevance in newborns admitted to the nursery . This is a retrospective review of medical records of neonates >/= 35 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of >/= 2000 g , who underwent partial sepsis work up with at least 2 consecutive CRP measurements within the first 48 h of life , between January and December CRP dynamics were analyzed using CRP velocity ( CRPv , mg/L/h ) , calculated by dividing the interval between the first two consecutive CRP measurements by the corresponding interval time . A total of 212 neonates were included in the study . Neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) presented with higher levels of CRPv ( p = 047 ) , and were more likely to experience hypoglycemia ( p = 023 ) and respiratory distress ( p = 023 ) . Lower CRPv levels were associated with elective cesarean surgery ( p = 043 ) . Among neonates with CRPv >/= 2 mg/L/h , female infants exhibited even higher CRPv values ( p = 018 ) . Only two cases of blood culture confirmed neonatal sepsis were identified , with CRPv values of 22 and 02 mg/L/h . , Neither case required NICU admission . Regression analyses revealed that higher gestational age was significantly associated with elevated CRPv levels ( p = 004 ) whereas hypothermia was linked to lower CRPv values ( p = 031 ) . In neonates , CRP dynamics generally corresponded to their overall clinical condition but were also influenced by various non infectious factors , including GA , mode of delivery and gender . Additionally , neonatologists should consider the recent finding that neonatal hypothermia was associated with decreased CRP levels when assessing ill appearing newborns with low CRP measurements .
The utilization of medicinal and psychoactive plants in the past represents a pivotal intersection of culture , health , and biodiversity . While such plants in Arabia have been known from classical and medieval textual records , this study provides material evidence of the use of one such plant for fumigation already in the Iron Age . Through metabolic profiling of organic residues recovered from archaeological artefacts at the oasis of Qurayyah , Northwest Arabia , we identified the drug plant Peganum harmala . Renowned for its antibacterial , psychoactive and multiple therapeutic properties , its presence highlights the deliberate utilization of local pharmacopeia by ancient communities . This discovery represents not only the first evidence for its use in Iron Age Arabia , but also the most ancient , radiometrically dated material evidence of Peganum harmala being used for fumigation globally . Beyond their health benefits , these plants were also valued for their sensory and affective properties . Documenting , understanding and preserving these ancient knowledge systems enriches our understanding of ancient traditions while safeguarding the region ' s intangible cultural heritage .
The retina is invariably considered an extension of the central nervous system and can predict cognitive impairment in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders . This is due to the physiological and embryological link between the retina and the brain . Since this correlation was not previously tested in autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , we aim to provide evidence for a correlation between retinal dysfunction and cognitive impairment in ASD children through previously reported retina and cognitive dysfunction biomarkers . 80 children were recruited to test biomarkers of the retinal function , Ciliary neurotrophic factor ( CNTF ) , and cognitive function A Disintegrin and Metalloproteases 10 ( ADAM10 ) . These biomarkers were correlated with the Childhood Autism Rating Score ( CARS ) to distinguish ASD from cognitive impairment disorders and the Short Sensory Profile ( SSP ) as a sensory impairment indicator , including vision . ADAM10 was significantly decreased in ASD children compared to neurotypical children ( p < 01 ) . It also decreased as the severity of autism increased , as measured by CARS . We also found that CNTF decreases in ASD children with moderate severity compared to neurotypical and severe ASD groups , indicating that CNTF can be an early indicator of ASD . ADAM10 was directly related to CNTF , implying the direct correlation between the eye and cognitive function in ASD . ADAM10 is a potential indicator of cognitive function in ASD , and CNTF can be an indicator of retina function . The relationship between both biomarkers might serve as early diagnosis biomarkers and a potential therapeutic target in ASD .
Over the last 250 years , anthropogenic activity has increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by nearly 40% . This increase is mainly caused by human fossil fuel combustion and deforestation , which are the main causes of global warming . Phytoplankton of the world ' s oceans synthesizes half of the carbon dioxide of the total Earth ' s photosynthetic activity . Thus , phytoplankton plays a crucial role in controlling Earth ' s climate . To study this scenario , we propose and analyze a mathematical model for the carbon phytoplankton zooplankton interaction dynamics . Positivity , boundedness , existence , and stability of biologically possible equilibrium points are studied . The system exhibits Hopf bifurcation with respect to the carbon capture coefficient and the criteria of Hopf bifurcation is established around the coexisting equilibrium . Complex spatiotemporal dynamics and patchy pattern formation are observed in the spatially explicit model . The proposed carbon phytoplankton zooplankton system incorporates the effect of global warming , and our simulation shows shifts in plankton seasonal dynamics .
The fall armyworm , Spodoptera frugiperda , is an invasive , polyphagous pest that threatens approximately 353 plant species across 72 families worldwide . Due to morphological similarities with other noctuid pests during the early larval , pupal , and adult stages , traditional identification methods are labour intensive and require specialist expertise . Rapid , reliable detection is essential given the pest ' s potential for widespread destruction . Through genome wide in silico analysis , this study identified a unique region within a signal peptide gene of S . frugiperda , which served as the basis for developing PCR , LAMP , and RPA based assays for detection . The PCR assay produced a specific 550 bp amplicon for S . frugiperda , showing no cross reactivity with negative controls . In the LAMP assay , positive samples exhibited a sky blue colour , while negative samples turned violet when hydroxynaphthol blue dye was used . The RPA assay , with SYBR green dye , displayed bright green in positive samples and brick red in negatives . Sensitivity tests demonstrated that PCR detected as low as 1 pg/microL , while LAMP and RPA achieved a higher sensitivity of 100 fg/microL . This study introduces the first RPA colorimetric assay for S . frugiperda , providing a time efficient , cost effective option that requires minimal equipment , ideal for field detection , thereby supporting timely pest monitoring and management .
Neoplastic transformation is accompanied by critical changes in cell mechanical properties , including reduced cell elasticity . By leveraging such mechanical flaw , exposure to low intensity therapeutic ultrasounds ( LITUS ) has been proposed as a tool for selective killing of cancer cells . Here , we have developed dynamic models to address the morpho mechanical differences between prostate cancer and non tumoral counterparts and studied the effects of LITUS on cell viability . We show that LITUS exposure ( 1 MHz ) leads to cancer selective cytoskeletal disruption associated to loss of nuclear envelope integrity , DNA damage marked by gammaH2AX and 53BP1 foci , and release of DNA into the cytosol with activation of the cGAS STING signaling cascade . Mechanistically , the LINC complex , which connects the cytoskeleton to nucleoskeleton and chromosomes , is critical to mediate nuclear rupture triggered by LITUS . Accordingly , genetic ablation of the LINC component SUN2 tuned down DNA damage and cGAS STING signaling while the inactivation of the endosomal sorting complex ( ESCRT ) , required for the transport machinery that preserves the nuclear envelope integrity , enhanced cell killing by LITUS . In conclusion , LITUS induce cancer cell DNA damage and an innate immune response , this suggesting LITUS treatment as a mechanobiology driven anti neoplastic strategy .
FOLFOX is widely used in the treatment of colon cancer . The combination of oxaliplatin ( OXA ) , 5 fluorouracil ( 5 FU ) , and leucovorin ( LV ) is administrated according to strict protocols . Based on incompatibility studies , LV and OXA are supplied concurrently via intravenous infusion , followed by intravenous administration of 5 FU . This study aims at determining the stability of the binary mixture of OXA and LV diluted in infusion bags containing either 5% dextrose or normal saline compared with their single solutions besides single solutions of 5 FU at two temperatures ( room temperature and refrigeration ) for two weeks . HPLC diode array detection method was developed and validated to simultaneously determine the three drugs . Stability studies in 5% dextrose solution revealed that mixtures of OXA and LV kept at room temperature showed chemical degradation for OXA , with better stability for refrigerated solutions . Generally , single solutions showed considerable stability . Using normal saline , a combination of OXA/LV showed relative stability of LV over the 15 days of study with marked degradation of OXA . 5 FU was relatively stable in 5% dextrose and normal saline at both temperatures . Method ' s applicability was extended to the determination of the cited drugs in plasma and colonic media samples . Method ' s sustainability , blueness , and whiteness were investigated .
COVID 19 patients often develop serious fungal infections like Aspergillosis , Candidiasis , and Mucormycosis , which are treated with antifungal drugs like Amphotericin B , Posaconazole , and Isavuconazole . However , these treatments are often insufficient , leading researchers to explore drug combinations and analogs . In theoretical chemistry , a chemical molecule is converted into an isomorphic molecular graph , represented as G ( V , E ) by considering atom set V as vertices and bond set E as edges . Quantitative structure activity/property/toxicity relationships ( QSAR , QSPR , QSTR ) modelling is a widely recognized discipline that correlates physicochemical and molecular descriptors with a drug ' s bioactivity to predict its standard pharmacological properties . In this article , the aforementioned drugs , as well as some Amphotericin B analogs , with their properties , are considered for QSPR/QSTR analysis . The QSPR/QSTR analysis is carried out using linear regression between the computed topological indices ( based on degree and neighbourhood degree sum ) and pharmacokinetic ( ADMET ) and toxicity properties ( LD ) of these drugs . The analysis reveals a strong correlation between the topological indices and the pharmacokinetic and toxicity properties of the drugs and their analogs . These insights are crucial for advancing more effective antifungal treatments , especially for COVID 19 related infections .
Wounds are common in equine practice , and often lead to complications such as infections , delayed healing and hypertrophic scarring , which can be costly and difficult to manage . Developing affordable and effective treatments has become an increasingly important focus in veterinary research . Equine advanced platelet rich fibrin plus ( A PRF+ ) demonstrates regenerative properties comparable to its human counterpart , but cellular level investigations exploring its molecular mechanisms remain limited . This study aimed to investigate the in vitro effects of equine A PRF + on primary fibroblast cell cultures . The secretome analysis of A PRF + revealed a complex protein profile involved in matrix remodelling , cell proliferation , and inflammation . Treatment with this platelet concentrate resulted in increased cell proliferation , enhanced migration , and significant changes in cell cycle progression compared to control groups . Reactive oxygen species production and organelles metabolism stimulation were observed , indicating active cellular responses , as well as an increase in genes and proteins associated with cell proliferation and wound regeneration . Proteomic analysis of treated fibroblasts confirmed the differential expression of key proteins associated with extracellular matrix dynamics and tissue regeneration processes . These findings provide insights into the molecular profile and functional responses of equine fibroblasts exposed to A PRF + , contributing to our understanding of its cellular effects , supporting further exploration of this product in regenerative medicine applications .
The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of UDP glycosyltransferases ( UGTs ) on alleviating the toxic effects of deoxynivalenol ( DON ) on Kunming mouse growth performance and gut damage . In this study , a total of 60 3 week old male Kunming mice were randomly divided into 4 groups and fed the following dietary and drug treatments for 7 weeks : CON , basal diet ; CTX , basal diet with i . p . injection of cyclophosphamide ( CTX ) ; CTX + DON , basal diet with 12 mg/kg DON and i . p . injection of cyclophosphamide ; and CTX + DON + UGTs , basal diet with 12 mg/kg DON and UGTs 1 mg/kg and i . p . injection of cyclophosphamide . Compared with those in the CON group , the growth performance , serum immunoglobulin contents ( IgG ) , antioxidant defense enzyme activities ( SOD ) , intestinal barrier integrity and permeability ( the ratio of villi length to crypt depth ) , tight junction proteins ( occludin and claudin 5 ) expression , intestinal cell apoptosis ( Bcl 2 ) , and histopathological lesions in the guts of the DON and CTX treated mice were significantly lower ( p < 05 ) . These negative effects on DON exposed mice were significantly mitigated when the mice received a UGT supplemented diet ( 1 mg/kg ) ( p < 05 ) . We concluded that UGTs could serve as dietary supplements to treat intestinal disorders associated with DON induced growth retardation in animals .
Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is associated with pain and cognitive impairment although exercise may improve some adverse outcomes . We hypothesized that transfer of plasma derived from exercised mice would improve outcomes related to pain and memory after TBI . These studies used a concussive murine model of mild TBI . Plasma from sedentary or exercised mice was administered to TBI mice beginning 3 days after injuries . Mechanical nociceptive sensitization and descending control of nociception ( DCN ) were assessed . Object recognition memory and Y maze were used to assess working memory . In addition , the spinal expression of Pdyn , Bdnf , Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 was measured 7 and 28 days after injuries . Levels of several candidate mediators of the exercise effects were measured in the transferred plasma . Mechanical allodynia following TBI recovered more quickly and DCN responses were partially preserved in animals receiving exercise plasma . Working memory was preserved in the same mice . The upregulation of spinal pain genes Pdyn and Bdnf was reduced by exercise plasma . Finally , exercise was associated with substantially higher plasma levels of TIMP2 and irisin . The present study suggests that developing therapies based on the administration of exercise plasma or its components may help reduce pain and cognitive loss after TBI .
Sulfur comproportionation , the coupled oxidation of sulfide and reduction of sulfate to elemental sulfur , is a heretofore undiscovered microbial catabolism that has been predicted based on thermodynamic calculations . Here , we report the isolation of an Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans strain that grew to cell densities of > 10 cells mL ( 1 ) in autotrophic sulfur comproportionation medium . It was isolated from extremely low pH snottite biofilms in the sulfidic karst at Frasassi , Italy . The organism ' s genome sequence revealed the presence of numerous genes involved in sulfur transformations that could be linked in a sulfur comproportionation pathway . Future investigations of this novel link in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle could include monitoring of the concentrations of sulfate , sulfide , and elemental sulfur during growth to learn whether they are consistent with stoichiometric ratios expected for sulfur comproportionation . In addition , stable and radioisotope incubations coupled with NanoSIMS , scintillation counting , and isotope ratio mass spectrometry should reveal that sulfate and sulfide are coupled in a single catabolic reaction to produce elemental sulfur .
Posttranscriptional and posttranslational modifications play crucial roles in plant immunity . However , how plants fine tune such modifications to activate antiviral immunity remains unknown . Here , we report that the mA methyltransferase TaHAKAI is utilized by wheat yellow mosaic virus ( WYMV ) to increase viral genomic mA modification and promote viral replication . However , TaHAKAI also functions as an E3 ligase that targets the viral RNA silencing suppressor P2 for degradation and inhibits viral infection . A major allele of TaHAKAI in a susceptible cultivar exhibited reduced E3 ligase activity but not mA methyltransferase activity , promoting viral infection . Interestingly , TaHAKAI ( R ) attenuates the stability of TaWPS1 ( Wheat paired spikelets 1 , WPS1 ) mRNA , the negative regulator of spike development , which might increase panicle length and spikelet number by modulating its mA modification . Our study reveals a mechanism for balancing disease resistance and yield by fine tuning mA modification and ubiquitination .
Although chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) caused cardiovascular diseases are frequently reported in clinics , the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood , which is primarily due to a lack of animal models . In this study , we report that CHIKV infection in homozygous interferon alpha/beta receptor deficient ( ifnar1 ( / ) ) and interferon alpha/beta/gamma receptor deficient ( ifnag ( / ) ) mice resulted in high viral loads in the hearts as early as day ( D ) 1 post infection ( p . i . ) but with 100% mortality within three days p . i . In contrast , the heterozygous ifnar1 ( +/ ) and ifnag ( +/ ) mice survived CHIKV infection and bore higher viral burdens in the heart tissues than the wild type ( WT ) controls . Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry revealed that more leukocytes , particularly neutrophils , infiltrated the heart of ifnag ( +/ ) and ifnar1 ( +/ ) mice than WT mice . In addition , the Hematoxylin and Eosin staining analysis showed that CHIKV infection caused vasculitis in the left ventricles on D5 p . i . in both heterozygous groups and the vacuole formation and pyknosis in ifnar1 ( +/ ) mice . Moreover , CHIKV infection may also lead to cardiac fibrosis , as indicated by the upregulation of the expression of the Connective Tissue Growth Factor gene in the hearts of ifnar1 ( +/ ) mice . In summary , our data suggest that the heterozygous ifnar1 ( +/ ) and ifnag ( +/ ) mice are invaluable for studying pathogenesis and testing therapeutic interventions for CHIKV caused cardiac diseases .
Gut microbes play a vital role in host physiology , but whether specific bacterial functions contribute to the exceptional athletic performance of racehorses needs to be better understood . Here , we identify an association of gut butyrate producing bacteria with athletic performance in racehorses ( Thoroughbred horse ) . Butyrate producing bacteria and microbial butyrate synthesis genes were significantly enriched in the racehorse gut , and the GC MS results confirmed this conclusion . Using a mouse model , we demonstrated that sodium butyrate is sufficient to increase treadmill run time performance . We also show that butyrate improves the host response to exercise , significantly altering muscle fibre type in skeletal muscle , and increasing muscle mitochondrial function and activity . In addition , in depth analysis of the published data showed that the gene for the synthesis of butyrate was also significantly enriched in the gut microbes of human athletes . Overall , our study indicates that gut microbial butyrate improves run time via the gut muscle axis , providing novel insights into gut microbial functions and paving the way for improving athletic performance by targeted gut microbiome manipulation .
Doxorubicin ( DOX ) is a key chemotherapeutic agent but is also a leading cause of DOX induced cardiotoxicity ( DIC ) , limiting its clinical use . Akkermansia muciniphila ( A . muciniphila ) , known for its benefits as a probiotic in treating metabolic syndrome , has uncertain effects in the context of DIC . Here , 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples from anthracycline treated patients and DIC mice revealed marked depletion of A . muciniphila . Cardiac transcriptomics , supported by in vitro experiments , showed that A . muciniphila colonization improved mitochondrial function and alleviated DIC by activating the PPARalpha/PGC1alpha signaling pathway in both normal and antibiotic treated C57BL/6 mice . Further analysis uncovered a restructured microbiome metabolome network following A . muciniphila administration , which contributed to DIC protection . Notably , A . muciniphila supplementation increased serum levels of the tryptophan metabolite indole 3 propionic acid ( IPA ) , which binds to the cardiac aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) , leading to the activation of the PPARalpha/PGC1alpha signaling pathway . In conclusion , our study sheds light on the potential of A . muciniphila as a probiotic in mitigating DIC .
Neovascular eye diseases represent a major cause of irreversible blindness . Here , we report the specific upregulation of endogenous PRL3 protein in diseased choroid RPE in choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) mouse model ( male ) , and diseased retina in oxygen induced retinopathy ( OIR ) mouse model ( mixed gender ) , indicating PRL3 ' s role in neovascularization . Intravenous ( IV ) delivery of anti PRL3 antibody in CNV model demonstrates superior efficacy in reducing vascular leakage compared to intravitreal ( IVT ) route due to larger dose permitted by IV . VEGF treatment upregulates endogenous PRL3 protein in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells ( HRMECs ) . Retroviral PRL3 overexpression in HRMECs promotes endothelial proliferation , migration and permeability by facilitating the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 , AKT , Paxillin and SRC . However , VEGF induced proliferation is absent in PRL3 knockout HRMECs . PRL3 zumab , an anti PRL3 humanized monoclonal antibody , has shown a strong safety profile in ongoing multi national Phase II trials as an intravenous administered cancer immunotherapeutic . PRL3 ' s involvement in ocular pathological angiogenesis suggests the potential of repurposing PRL3 zumab to treat neovascular eye diseases .
Arsenic ' s water solubility facilitates its entry into the food chain , threatening health , food security , and the economy . Restricting arsenic within the crop root zone is crucial , as contaminated topsoil of agricultural fields can ' t be removed . This study evaluates the arsenic immobilization capacity of the Laterite Biochar Composite ( LBC ) in the soil through batch , column , and pot studies . The batch experiments assess the adsorption , thermodynamic , and kinetics behavior of LBC . At the same time , a column study examines the arsenic restriction capacity within a 25 cm soil depth , representing the root growth region of the paddy . The pot experiment demonstrates that progressively increasing LBC dose reduces arsenic uptake from roots to grains in rice plants grown in arsenic contaminated soil ( 106 mg arsenic/kg soil ) . The research ' s novelty lies in the innovative synthesis of LBC and experiment design , revealing insight into a dual arsenic immobilization mechanism in the soil through the formation of iron plaque over the root as a mass transfer barrier between the soil interface and the root surface . LBC decreases arsenic levels in rice seeds by 5% , 76% , and 5% at 2% , 1% , and 5% wt% LBC in the soil during pot experiments , respectively , while enhancing soil health by increasing soil microbial activity , mineral content , and organic carbon .
Frailty is an age related geriatric syndrome . We performed a longitudinal study of aging female ( n = 40 ) and male ( n = 47 ) C57BL/6NIA mice , measured frailty index and derived metabolomics data from plasma . We identify age related differentially abundant metabolites , determine frailty related metabolites , and generate frailty features , both in the whole cohort and sex stratified subgroups . Using the features , we perform an association study and build a metabolomics based frailty clock . We find that frailty related metabolites are enriched for amino acid metabolism and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins , include ergothioneine , tryptophan and alpha ketoglutarate , and present sex dimorphism . We identify B vitamin metabolism related flavin adenine dinucleotide and pyridoxate as female specific frailty biomarkers , and lipid metabolism related sphingomyelins , glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine as male specific frailty biomarkers . These associations are confirmed in a validation cohort , with ergothioneine and perfluorooctanesulfonate identified as robust frailty biomarkers . Our results identify sex specific metabolite frailty biomarkers , and shed light on potential mechanisms .
While the movement of rodents can be paused by optogenetic stimulation of a brainstem nucleus , the pedunculopontine nucleus ( PPN ) , it is unknown whether this response has a functional purpose . The arrest appears conspicuously similar to fear induced freezing behavior and could constitute a general halting mechanism for movement without an emotional component . Further , it is unclear to what extent brain activity is affected by the evoked motor arrest . Here , we investigate this phenomenon by engaging a distinct brain activity , the hippocampal theta rhythm . The theta rhythm is prominent during locomotor activity , absent under normal immobile situations , yet present under vigilant states like fear induced freezing . Specifically , we ask whether the PPN induced motor arrest has the same effect on the theta rhythm as if the animal would perform a volitional arrest , which results in the disappearance of the theta rhythm , or whether it would cause a continuation of the theta rhythm as would be expected by a fear induced motor arrest . An alternative hypothesis is that the theta rhythm represents an ongoing intention to move rather than the movement itself . To distinguish between these two possibilities , we recorded the hippocampal brain rhythm before and during movement arrest induced by optogenetic stimulation of the PPN in rats . The PPN induced motor arrest was associated with a clear obstruction of the ongoing theta activity . The timescale of movement arrest was less than 200 ms , similar to the obstruction of the theta rhythm . Since fear and behavioral freezing are associated with hippocampal theta rhythm , which we did not see during PPN stimulation , we suggest that induced motor arrest occurs without an associated emotional component . Further , our experiments reveal that the theta rhythm during motor activity does not represent an intention , but rather the ongoing sensory motor state .
Labeling cellular biomolecules via copper catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition ( CuAAC ) offers rapid reaction kinetics and uses small azide and alkyne probes that minimally disturb molecular function , making it ideal for tracking biomolecules . However , applying CuAAC inside living cells has been hindered by the high copper levels required , which compromise cell health . To overcome this barrier , here , we develop inCu click , an intracellular CuAAC approach that employs a DNA conjugated ligand ( BTT DNA ) to localize and concentrate copper ions at the reaction site . This design permits efficient click chemistry at low intracellular copper concentrations without added copper salts and supports template driven proximity and liposomal delivery of the ligand into cells . Here we show that inCu click enables robust fluorescent labeling of nascent phospholipids and proteins in live cells with negligible impact on viability , establishing a platform for real time visualization of biomolecule dynamics in complex , live cell environments .
Specification of primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) establishes germline development during early embryogenesis , yet the underlying mechanisms in humans remain largely unknown . Here , we reveal the functional roles of germline specific RNA binding protein ( RBP ) DND1 in human PGC ( hPGC ) specification . We discovered that DND1 forms a complex with another RBP , NANOS3 , to restrict hPGC specification . Furthermore , by analyzing the mRNAs bound by DND1 and NANOS3 , we found that DND1 facilitates the binding of NANOS3 to hPGC like cells related mRNAs . We identified SOX4 mRNAs as the key downstream factor for the DND1 and NANOS3 complex . Mechanistically , DND1 and NANOS3 function in processing bodies ( P bodies ) to repress the translation of SOX4 mRNAs , with NANOS3 mediating the interaction between DND1 and the translational repressor 4E T . Altogether , these findings identify the RBP complex formed by DND1 and NANOS3 functioning as a " braking system " to restrict the entry of germ cell fate in humans .
Exosomes , as cell derived lipid nanoparticles , are promising drug carriers because they can traverse challenging physiological barriers such as the blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . However , a major obstacle in utilizing exosomes as drug carriers is loading large therapeutic molecules without compromising the structural integrity of embedded biomolecules . Here , we introduce a membrane fusion method utilizing fusogenic lipid nanoparticles , cubosomes , to load large molecules into exosomes in a non destructive manner . When the drug loaded cubosome and exosome solutions are simply mixed , membrane fusion is completed in just 10 min . Our method effectively loads doxorubicin and immunoglobulin G into exosomes . Moreover , even the most challenging molecule mRNA is loaded with nearly 100% efficiency , demonstrating the versatility of our approach . In terms of biological behavior , the resulting hybrid exosomes preserve the functional behavior of exosomes in BBB uptake and penetration . Surprisingly , controlling exosome to cubosome ratios allows precise control over BBB uptake and transport . Furthermore , these hybrid exosomes retain cell specific delivery properties , preserving the targeted delivery functions dictated by their exosomal origin . This study demonstrates the feasibility of a mix and load method for rapid and efficient drug loading into exosomes , with significant potential for the treatment of neurological diseases .
Proteolysis targeting chimeras ( PROTACs ) present a potentially effective strategy against various diseases via selective proteolysis . How to increase the efficacy of PROTACs remains challenging . Here , we explore the necessity of the linker , which has been deemed as an integral part of heterobifunctional PROTACs . Adopting single amino acid based degradation signals , we find that the linker is not a required feature of the PROTACs . Notably , the linker free PROTAC , Pro BA , exhibits superior efficacy over its linker bearing counterparts in degrading EML4 ALK and inhibiting lung cancer cell growth , as Pro BA induces a stronger interaction between the target and the E3 ubiquitin ligase . Pro BA is a water soluble , orally administered degrader that significantly inhibits the tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model . The broad applicability of this linker free PROTAC strategy is further validated through the development of BCR ABL degrader . Our study introduces a design paradigm for PROTACs , potentially facilitating the advancement of more efficient therapeutic degraders .
The corneal epithelium serves as the front barrier against environmental stimuli and pathogens on the ocular surface . A comprehensive protein profile of the corneal epithelium would be crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms that are related to corneal disease . This work demonstrated a library free data independent acquisition ( DIA ) approach across different mass spectrometers and proteomic software to build a comprehensive proteomic dataset for human corneal epithelial cells ( HCECs ) . With the combinational use of different data independent acquisition technologies of multiple mass spectrometers , including Sciex ZenoTOF 7600 ( DIA SWATH ) , Bruker TimsTOF Pro2 ( DIA PASEF ) , and ThermoFisher Orbitrap Fusion Lumos ( DIA HRMS1 ) , protein identification and quantification were performed with superior sensitivity and resolution . By using a library free DIA approach , this study constructed a more diverse and unbiased proteomic profile of human corneal epithelial cells ( HCECs ) , comprising 11 , 954 protein groups ( 1% FDR ) . This represents the largest corneal proteome reported to date . All raw proteomic data were deposited to ProteomeXchange Consortium via Proteomics Identifications database ( PRIDE ) with the dataset identifier accession number PXD Our findings hold the potential to enhance future understanding of corneal pathologies and transformative therapeutics .
In vivo gene therapy to the liver using lentiviral vectors ( LV ) may represent a one and done therapeutic approach for monogenic diseases . Increasing LV gene therapy potency is crucial for reducing the effective doses , thus alleviating dose dependent toxicities and facilitating manufacturing . LV mediated liver transduction may be enhanced by positively selecting LV transduced hepatocytes after treatment ( a posteriori ) or by augmenting the initial fraction of LV targeted hepatocytes ( a priori ) . We show here that the a posteriori enhancement increased transgene output without expansion of hepatocytes bearing LV genomic integrations near cancer genes , in mouse models of hemophilia , an inherited coagulation disorder . Furthermore , we enhanced hepatocyte transduction a priori in mice by transiently inhibiting antiviral pathways and/or through a fasting regimen . The most promising transduction enhancer combination synergized with phagocytosis shielded LV , resulting in a remarkable 40 fold increase in transgene output . Overall , our work highlights the potential of minimally invasive , cost effective treatments capable of improving the potency of in vivo LV gene therapy to hepatocytes , in order to expand its applicability and ease clinical translation .
The spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) ensures mitotic exit occurs only after sister chromatid biorientation , but how this coordination is mechanistically achieved remains unclear . Kinetochores , the megadalton complexes linking chromosomes to spindle microtubules , contribute to SAC signaling . However , whether they act solely as docking platforms or actively promote the co orientation of SAC catalysts such as MAD1 : MAD2 and BUB1 : BUB3 remains unresolved . Here , we reconstitute kinetochores and SAC signaling in vitro to address this question . We engineer recombinant kinetochore particles that recruit core SAC components and trigger checkpoint signaling upon Rapamycin induction , and test their function using a panel of targeted mutants . At approximately physiological concentrations of SAC proteins , kinetochores are essential for efficient mitotic checkpoint complex ( MCC ) assembly , the key effector of SAC signaling . Our results suggest that kinetochores serve not only as structural hubs but also as catalytic platforms that concentrate and spatially organize SAC components to accelerate MCC formation and ensure timely checkpoint activation .
BACKGROUND : Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is highly prevalent , particularly among south Asian populations , and diet is the first line strategy to manage postprandial glucose ( PG ) response . Mycoprotein and guar gum reduce PG in normo glycaemic people . This study investigates the independent and interactive effects of mycoprotein and guar gum on PG , insulin and appetite responses in white Europeans and south Asians with T2D . METHODS : In this double blind , crossover , acute , randomised controlled trial , 18 subjects with T2D ( 10 white European , 8 south Asian ) completed six separate visits consuming soy , chicken , and mycoprotein with and without guar gum . Incremental area under the curve ( iAUC ( 0 180 min ) ) for PG , insulin , and appetite scores , and total AUC ( 0 180 min ) glucagon like peptide 1 ( GLP 1 ) , peptide tyrosine tyrosine ( PYY ) , as well as ad libitum energy intake and 48h post visit energy intake were measured and analysed by linear mixed models with protein , guar gum and ethnicity as fixed effects . RESULTS : We found independent effects of mycoprotein , guar gum and ethnicity on PG iAUC ( 0 180 min ) ( mmol/L . min ) , where mycoprotein reduced PG vs . chicken ( 84 [95% CI 16 , 51] ; p = 002 ) , guar gum reduced PG vs . no guar gum ( 35 [95% CI 30 , 40 ; p < 001] , and south Asian had increased PG vs . white Europeans ( 75 [95% CI 14 , 35] ; p = 005 ) . An interaction between guar gum and ethnicity ( p < 015 ) was found for insulin iAUC ( 0 180 min ) ( microUI/mL . min ) , with guar gum lowering insulin responses in south Asian participants ( 69 [95% CI 83 , 511] ; p < 001 ) . No independent or interactive effects were observed for appetite related outcomes . CONCLUSION : Mycoprotein and guar gum promote significant independent effects in lowering PG in both white European and south Asians with T2D .
Malaria parasite undergoes interesting developmental transition in human and mosquito host . While it divides asynchronously in the erythrocytes , it switches to sexual forms , which is critical for disease transmission . We report a novel signalling pathway involving Protein Phosphatase PfPPM2 , which regulates asexual division of Plasmodium falciparum as well as its conversion to sexual forms . PfPPM2 may regulate the phosphorylation of key proteins involved in chromatin remodelling and protein translation . One of the key PfPPM2 targets was Heterochromatin Protein 1 ( HP1 ) , a regulator of heritable gene silencing which contributes to both mitotic proliferation as well as sexual commitment of the parasite . PfPPM2 promotes sexual conversion by regulating the interaction between HP1 , H3K9me3 and chromatin and it achieves this by dephosphorylating S33 of HP PfPPM2 also regulates protein synthesis in the parasite by repressing the phosphorylation of initiation factor eIF2alpha , which is likely to contribute to parasite division and possibly sexual differentiation .
Plant pathogens significantly threaten food security and agricultural sustainability , with climate change expected to exacerbate outbreaks . Despite these growing threats , current agrochemical delivery remains untargeted and inefficient . In this study , we develop surface ligand engineered nanoparticles for targeted delivery to stomata ( SENDS ) , a nanocarrier system designed to target stomatal guard cells , which serve as key pathogen entry points into the plant apoplast . Our approach employs rational ligand engineering of porous nanoparticles , optimizing ligand orientation for efficient stomata targeting across different plant species . Foliar application of SENDS encapsulating an antimicrobial plant alkaloid reduces colonization of Xanthomonas campestris , a major crop pathogen , by 20 fold compared to untargeted nanocarriers . Quantitative assessment of stomatal aperture movement and photosynthetic performance confirms that SENDS enhance plant defense against invading pathogens without disrupting natural stomatal function . This nanobiotechnology approach provides a targeted strategy to improve plant disease resistance , offering new insights into nanocarrier design for more resilient and sustainable agriculture .
How homeodomain proteins gain sufficient DNA binding specificity to regulate diverse processes is a long standing question . Here , we determine how the ALX4 Paired like protein achieves DNA binding specificity for a TAAT NNN ATTA dimer site . We first show that ALX4 binds this motif independently of its co factor , TWIST1 , in cranial neural crest cells . Structural analysis identifies seven ALX4 residues that participate in dimer binding , many of which are conserved across the Paired like family , but not other homeodomain proteins . Unexpectedly , the two ALX4 proteins within the dimer use distinct residues to form asymmetric protein protein and protein DNA interactions and mediate cooperativity . Moreover , we find that ALX4 cooperativity is required for transcriptional activation and that ALX4 disease variants cause distinct molecular defects that include loss of cooperativity . These findings provide insights into how Paired like factors gain DNA specificity and show how disease variants can be stratified based on their molecular defects .
We evaluated temporal and genetic relationships between 176 food liking traits and cardio metabolic diseases using data from the UK Biobank ( N = 182 , 087 ) for observational analyses and summary level GWAS data from FinnGen and other consortia ( N = 406 , 565 977 , 323 ) for genetic analyses . Integrating observational and genetic results , we identified two detrimental food liking traits ( bacon and diet fizzy drinks ) and three protective food liking traits ( broccoli , pizza , and lentils/beans ) . These food liking traits are associated with habitual food intake and influence cardio metabolic proteins and biological processes . Notably , we found three genetic links : diet fizzy drinks with heart failure , bacon with type 2 diabetes , and lentils/beans with type 2 diabetes , identifying 54 pleiotropic single nucleotide variants , impacting both phenotypes . Our data show the diet fizzy drinks and heart failure link maybe not direct , as diet fizzy drinks liking correlates with sweet food consumption and shares variants linked to BMI , adiposity , platelet count and cardio metabolic traits . The pleiotropic single nucleotide variants map to 251 tissue specific genes , with four showing high druggability potential , highlighting personalized dietary strategies for cardio metabolic diseases .
Despite the STING type I interferon pathway playing a key role in effective anti tumor immunity , the therapeutic benefit of direct STING agonists appears limited . In this study , we use several artificial intelligence techniques and patient based multi omics data to show that Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase 1 ( ENPP1 ) , which hydrolyzes STING activating cyclic GMP AMP ( cGAMP ) , is a safer and more effective STING modulating target than direct STING agonism in multiple solid tumors . We then leverage our generative chemistry artificial intelligence based drug design platform to facilitate the design of ISM5939 , an orally bioavailable ENPP1 selective inhibitor capable of stabilizing extracellular cGAMP and activating bystander antigen presenting cells without inducing either toxic inflammatory cytokine release or tumor infiltrating T cell death . In murine syngeneic models across cancer types , ISM5939 synergizes with targeting the PD 1/PD L1 axis and chemotherapy in suppressing tumor growth with good tolerance . Our findings provide evidence supporting ENPP1 as an innate immune checkpoint across solid tumors and reports an AI design aided ENPP1 inhibitor , ISM5939 , as a cutting edge STING modulator for cancer therapy , paving a path for immunotherapy advancements .
Age related osteoporosis poses a significant challenge in musculoskeletal health ; a condition characterized by reduced bone density and increased fracture susceptibility in older individuals necessitates a better understanding of underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms . Emerging evidence suggests that osteocytes are the pivotal orchestrators of bone remodeling and represent novel therapeutic targets for age related bone loss . Our study uses the prematurely aged Polg ( D257A/D257A ) ( PolgA ) mouse model to scrutinize age and sex related alterations in musculoskeletal health parameters ( frailty , grip strength , gait data ) , bone and particularly the osteocyte lacuno canalicular network ( LCN ) . Moreover , a new quantitative in silico image analysis pipeline is used to evaluate the alterations in the osteocyte network with aging . Our findings underscore the pronounced degenerative changes in the musculoskeletal health parameters , bone , and osteocyte LCN in PolgA mice as early as 40 weeks , with more prominent alterations evident in aged males . Our findings suggest that the PolgA mouse model serves as a valuable model for studying the cellular mechanisms underlying age related bone loss , given the comparable aging signs and age related degeneration of the bone and the osteocyte network observed in naturally aging mice and elderly humans .
Microscopic colitis ( MC ) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine that primarily affects older adults and presents with chronic diarrhea . The etiology is unknown and there are currently no FDA approved medications or biomarkers for treatment or monitoring of the disease . Emerging evidence have implicated the gut microbiome and metabolome disturbances in MC pathogenesis . We conduct a comprehensive analysis of gut microbial and metabolic changes in a cohort of 683 participants , including 131 patients with active MC , 159 with chronic diarrhea , and 393 age and sex matched controls without diarrhea . Stool microbiome and metabolome are profiled using whole genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing and ultra high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry , respectively . Compared to controls , eight microbial species including pro inflammatory oral typical Veillonella dispar and Haemophilus parainfluenzae , and 11 species , including anti inflammatory Blautia glucerasea and Bacteroides stercoris are enriched and depleted in MC , respectively . Pro inflammatory metabolites , including lactosylceramides , ceramides , lysophospholipids , and lysoplasmalogens , are enriched in active MC . Multi omics analyses reveal robust associations between microbial species , metabolic pathways , and metabolites , suggesting concordant disruptions in MC . Here , we show distinct shifts in gut microbiome and metabolome in MC that can inform the development of non invasive biomarkers and novel therapeutics .
Methamphetamine ( METH ) is a highly addictive psychostimulant , yet its addiction mechanisms remain unclear . Oxytocin ( OXT ) , a neuropeptide , shows promise in reducing METH addiction , but how OXT exerts its effects is poorly understood . Using conditioned place preference ( CPP ) , we first found that intranasal OXT other than Arginine Vasopressin ( AVP ) administration suppressed METH CPP in mice , which could be reversed by OXT receptors ( OXTRs ) blockade in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core . Activating OXTRs in the NAc core similarly reduced METH CPP . Then , we found repeated METH exposure inhibited oxytocinergic neurons within the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) and lowered PVN OXT protein level . Chemogenetic activation of PVN oxytocinergic neurons ( PVN ( OXT ) ) blocked METH CPP . Furthermore , METH inhibited PVN ( OXT ) NAc core circuit other than PVN ( OXT ) NAc shell circuit . Activation of PVN ( OXT ) NAc core circuit significantly inhibited METH CPP . This study reveals METH may impair the endogenous OXT system , especially the PVN ( OXT ) NAc core circuit , highlighting OXT ' s therapeutic potential for METH use disorder ( MUD ) .
While Chimeric Antigen Receptor ( CAR ) T cell therapy may result in durable remissions in recurrent large B cell lymphoma , persistence is limited and the mechanisms underlying long term response are not fully elucidated . Using longitudinal single cell immunoprofiling , here we compare the immune landscape in durable remission versus early relapse patients following CD19 CAR T cell infusion in the NCT02348216 ( ZUMA 1 ) trial . Four weeks post infusion , both cohorts demonstrate low circulating CAR T cells . We observe that long term remission is associated with elevated native cytotoxic and proinflammatory effector cells , and post infusion clonotypic expansion of effector memory T cells . Conversely , early relapse is associated with impaired NK cell cytotoxicity and elevated immunoregulatory cells , potentially dampening native T cell activation . Thus , we suggest that durable remission to CAR T is associated with a distinct T cell signature and pattern of clonotypic expansion within the native T cell compartment post therapy , consistent with their contribution to the maintenance of response .
The tumor environment of prostate cancer ( PCa ) tissues of high Gleason score has been proved to be more immune suppressive and has higher extracellular matrix ( ECM ) stiffness , but whether ECM mechanical stiffness is the cause of higher ability of invasiveness and immune escape of PCa with high Gleason score remains uncertain . In this study , we showed that higher polyacrylamide hydrogels ( PAAG ) stiffness resulted in the progression and immune escape of PCa via integrin beta1/FAK/YAP axis . The translocation of YAP into cell nucleus to bind to TEAD2 promoted the transcriptional activation of USP NBR1 could be ubiquitinated , and then degraded , via interacting with P62/SQSTM1 and through autophagy lysosome pathway . Increased expression of USP8 promoted the abundance of NBR1 via K63 linked de ubiquitination and PD L1 via K48 linked de ubiquitination in response to high PAAG stiffness . NBR1 mediated selective autophagy accelerated the degradation of MHC 1 of PCa . The USP8 inhibitor presented a potential application value in sensitizing immunotherapy of PCa . Taken together , we identified a USP8 mediated de ubiquitination mechanism that involves in the process of high PAAG stiffness mediated high expression of PD L1 and low expression of MHC 1 of PCa cells , which provided a rationale of immunotherapy sensitization of PCa via USP8 inhibition .
Genotoxic stress induced stem cell maldifferentiation ( GSMD ) integrates DNA damage responses with loss of stemness and lineage specific differentiation to prevent damaged stem cell propagation . However , molecular mechanisms governing GSMD remain unclear . Here , we identify the p53 induced long non coding RNA LOC644656 as a key regulator of GSMD in human embryonic stem cells . LOC644656 accumulates in the nucleus upon DNA damage , disrupting pluripotency by interacting directly with POU5F1 and KDM1A/LSD1 NuRD complexes , repressing stemness genes , and activating TGF beta signaling . Additionally , LOC644656 mitigates DNA damage by binding DNA PKcs and modulating the DNA damage response . In cancer , elevated LOC644656 correlates with poor patient survival and enhanced chemoresistance . Our findings demonstrate that LOC644656 mediates stemness suppression and resistance to genotoxic stress by coordinating DNA damage signaling and differentiation pathways . Thus , LOC644656 represents a potential therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance and advancing stem cell biology .
Precise control of enzymatic cascade pathways is essential for deepening our understanding of metabolic processes and designing synthetic biochemical systems . In this study , we present a novel approach to modulate these cascades using light responsive DNA droplets . Y motif sequences with azobenzene modified sticky ends were designed to form DNA droplets via liquid liquid phase separation . These droplets enable selective sequestration of enzymes within compartments , allowing dynamic regulation of enzymatic cascades in response to ultraviolet and visible light stimuli . As a model system , we employed an incompatible enzymatic cascade involving glucose oxidase ( GOx ) , horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) , and catalase ( CAT ) . Under visible light , the DNA droplets co localize enzymes within the compartments , effectively regulating metabolic flux without altering the total enzyme concentration . Upon ultraviolet exposure , the droplets disassemble , releasing the sequestered enzymes and altering cascade dynamics . The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated using an alternative enzymatic cascade system comprising galactose oxidase ( GAO ) , myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) , and catalase ( CAT ) . This system demonstrates that light responsive DNA droplets are a powerful tool for regulating enzymatic pathways , with potential applications in synthetic biology , microreactor design , and bioengineering .
Breast milk is considered as a living ecosystem . Maternal , environmental and neonatal factors affect milk bacterial composition . The aim of present study was to assess the phyla from breast milk of mothers with vaginal delivery compared to the cesarean section . In this single center case control study , sixty women were participated . Half of them had vaginal delivery and others experienced cesarean section . The breast milk samples were collected three months after delivery for the DNA extraction to measure Firmicutes , Bacteroidetes , Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria using quantitative real time chain polymerase reaction . Daily intake of calories , protein , fat , carbohydrate and fiber did not differ significantly between the two groups . The proportion of Bacteroidetes , Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were significantly higher in milk of mothers with a cesarean section than the vaginal delivery ( p=03 , p=02 and p=042 ) . Similarly , the Firmicutes to Bacteroides ratio was significantly increased ( p=02 ) . The Actinobacteria population was significantly higher in milk of vaginally delivered mothers who had male infant than females ( p=015 ) . Breast milk of mothers with cesarean section showed alterations in the main bacterial phyla population compared to the vaginal delivery . Moreover , our results suggest that the sex of infant is an effective factor on some phyla quantity .
Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is an aggressive hematological cancer with a 70% five year mortality rate . Relapse occurs in approximately half of adults treated with intensive chemotherapy , while responses to targeted therapies are short lasting . Frequent mutations in signaling pathways , such as FLT3 tyrosine kinase and RAS , lead to dysregulated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) and mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling , increased protein synthesis , enhanced mitochondrial fitness , and metabolic adaptations that drive leukemic cell proliferation and survival . Here , emerging evidence supporting the unique role of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F as a key driver of the expression of proteins regulating leukemic cell metabolism and survival and the potential therapeutic benefit of targeting this pathway pharmacologically in AML are discussed .
CD73 , an emerging immune checkpoint , plays a pivotal role in the adenosine ( ADO ) metabolic pathway by catalyzing the conversion of AMP to ADO . This process has been shown to inhibit the functions of T cells and natural killer ( NK ) cells , thereby exacerbating the immunosuppressive effects within the tumor microenvironment . These findings underscore the critical role of CD73 in modulating immune cell function and represent a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment . Herein , a series of novel CD73 inhibitors featuring a 1H , 3H dihydro 2 , 4 pyrimidinone moiety was achieved . Notably , XC 12 exhibited potent in vitro anti CD73 activity against both soluble and membrane bound forms ( IC = 36 and 29 nM , respectively ) . Furthermore , XC 12 was orally bioavailable and significantly inhibited the tumor growth in the CT26 syngeneic mouse model ( TGI : 74% ) at a dose of 135 mg/kg . These results suggest that XC 12 may serve as a promising candidate for cancer immunotherapy . FAU Cen , Lifang
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : White matter injury ( WMI ) is associated with cognitive dysfunction in aging population ; however , a clinicoradiological discrepancy often arises between WMI and cognition function in clinical practice . Emerging evidence suggests that the glymphatic system plays a crucial role in clearing metabolic waste and maintaining cognitive function . We hypothesize that glymphatic dysfunction may contribute to this discrepancy by moderating the impact of WMI on cognition . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We conducted a retrospective review of community dwelling residents in our center who underwent multimodal MRI scan and neuropsychological testing from April 2017 to December WMI , as indicated by white matter hyperintensities ( WMHs ) and normal appearing white matter ( NAWM ) microstructural injury , along with cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) , were quantified by multimodal MRI . Cognition was assessed by mini mental state examination ( MMSE ) . Glymphatic function was evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space ( DTI ALPS ) . Moderation analyses were performed to explore the potential role of glymphatic function . RESULTS : A total of 947 participants were included in the final analysis . A higher WMHs burden was found to be associated with lower MMSE scores in the low DTI ALPS group ( r = 261 , p <001 ) , but the correlation was not significant in the high DTI ALPS group ( r = 082 , p = 07 ) . After adjusting for confounding factors , DTI ALPS moderated the relationship between WMHs burden and MMSE score ( beta = 792 , p = 02 ) , and the moderating effect was significant in participants aged </=60 years old ( beta = 573 , p = 04 ) , without lacunes ( beta = 576 , p = 01 ) or without cerebral microbleeds ( beta = 008 , p = 004 ) . Longitudinal analysis demonstrated that DTIALPS also moderated the relationship between WMHs burden and cognitive decline ( beta = 771 , p =001 ) . Furthermore , DTI ALPS moderated the relationship between NAWM microstructural injury and MMSE score ( beta = 201 , p =01 ) , but no moderating effect was detected between CBF and MMSE score ( p > 05 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Glymphatic system plays a moderate role in the association between WMI and cognitive impairment , highlighting its potential importance in WMI related cognitive impairment . Further studies are needed to explore the relative mechanisms .

INTRODUCTION : Statins are among the most widely used drugs . While they are effective for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular ( CV ) disease in middle aged subjects , their benefits for prevention in older adults ( aged >/=70 years ) without CV disease are uncertain , particularly for those with multimorbidity . Statin side effects and drug interactions are common in older patients and may negatively impact quality of life . To date , the only randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) investigating statin discontinuation in older adults has demonstrated no difference in survival but did note a small improvement in quality of life for those who discontinued statins . However , this trial exclusively enrolled patients with a life expectancy <1 year . Therefore , the present RCT aims to assess the safety and potential benefits of statin discontinuation in primary prevention for the ever growing population of multimorbid older adults . METHODS AND ANALYSIS : This study is a multicentre , randomised , non inferiority trial conducted in both inpatient and outpatient settings in Switzerland , France and the Netherlands , targeting patients using statins for primary prevention . 1800 participants are randomly assigned 1 : 1 to either discontinue ( intervention arm ) or continue ( control arm ) statin therapy . The primary objective is to compare the primary composite endpoint of major CV events ( non fatal myocardial infarction or non fatal ischaemic stroke ) and all cause death between the control and intervention groups over a follow up duration of up to 48 months . We hypothesise that discontinuing statins does not result in shorter event free survival , with a non inferiority margin set at 2 weeks over a 2 year observation period . Secondary objectives are to compare patient centred outcomes ( health related quality of life , muscle pain symptoms , falls and sarcopenia ) and all cause death , non CV death , major CV events and coronary and peripheral artery revascularisation . The study is open labelled , with blinded outcome adjudication of the primary endpoints . ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION : The trial protocol has received approval from the local ethics committees in Switzerland , France and the Netherlands . Results will be published in a peer reviewed journal . TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER : Clinicaltrials . gov : NCT05178420 ; BASEC ( Swiss Ethics Commission ) : 2021 01513 ; FOPH ( Swiss national portal ) : SNCTP000005172 ; Netherlands Trial Register : NL23 ; France Trial Register : 000158 IDRCB 2022 A02481
INTRODUCTION : Sarcopenia and frailty have been identified as negative predictors of health outcomes . Patients with stroke , traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) and breast cancer commonly experience low physical activity levels in the chronic phase of recovery . This prospective study aims to explore the feasibility of multimodal screening and longitudinal tracking of various biomarkers from the acute to chronic phase of disease to determine the relationship with frailty outcomes . METHODS AND ANALYSIS : A prospective longitudinal observational cohort study involving Asian populations is planned over 3 years . Enrolled participants with index conditions of acute stroke , TBI , knee OA and breast cancer will be recruited from rehabilitation hospitals and clinics and followed longitudinally . Reference thresholds from the Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia will be used . Variables include self reported questionnaires , disease and comorbidity characteristics , anthropometric measurements , appetite questionnaires , muscle ultrasound ( MUS ) , muscle/bone mass , blood biomarkers and markerless gait motion systems . In particular , physical performance ( short physical performance battery and hand grip strength ) , sarcopenia ( SARC F questionnaire ) and frailty assessment ( FRAIL score , clinical frailty scale ) , four region MUS , body composition analysis , dual X ray absorptiometry , bone mineral densitometry , physical activity levels ( International Physical Activity Questionnaire for the elderly [IPAQ E] , fitness trackers ) and health related quality of life assessment ( EuroQoL 5D questionnaire five level [EQ5D 5L] ) will be used . Blood biomarkers measuring metabolic health ( eg , glycated haemoglobin , cholesterol , fasting glucose and 25 OH vitamin D ) and inflammation ( eg , Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha [TNF alpha] and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein 1 [MCP 1] ) will be measured at baseline . Data collection will take place at postrecruitment baseline ( hospital admission ) , 1 , 6 months , 12 months and 2 years postrecruitment ( inpatient ) and at postrecruitment baseline , 6 months , 12 months and 2 years postrecruitment ( outpatient ) . ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION : Ethical approval has been obtained from the National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board ( 2023/00105 ) . Findings will be disseminated through conference presentations and publication in scientific journals . TRIAL REGISTERATION NUMBER : NCT
BACKGROUND : Recent studies showed an increase in neuroendocrine neoplasms , especially for the digestive tract . Several risk factors have been suggested to explain this increase , including a family history of cancer , tobacco smoking , alcohol consumption and metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity . Another risk factor may be depressive disorders , which could increase the risk of neuroendocrine neoplasms either directly or mediated through associated risk behaviours and/or antidepressant medication . Here , we outline the design of our study to identify the risk factors for neuroendocrine neoplasms in Germany . METHODS AND ANALYSIS : A case control study of the resident population of Bavaria , the second most populous federal state in Germany , based on a record linkage of data from the Bavarian Cancer Registry and data from the Bavarian Association of Statutory Health Insurance Accredited Physicians . Cases have a diagnosis of a malignant neuroendocrine neoplasm , either of the bronchopulmonary system or the gastroenteropancreatic system , in the period from 2021 to Controls are sampled from the non cases and matched on sex , birth year ( in 5 year intervals ) and time of diagnosis ( by calendar quarter ) . Risk factor prevalence of cases and controls is assessed on the basis of assured outpatient diagnoses , that is , diagnoses documented in at least 2 out of 4 consecutive quarters in the 16 quarters preceding the diagnosis of a neuroendocrine neoplasm . The analysis uses conditional logistic regression to estimate ORs and 95% CIs . ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION : This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Bavarian State Chamber of Physicians ( reference number : 24008 ) . Approval by the supervisory authority has been obtained from the Bavarian State Ministry of Health , Care , and Prevention ( reference number : G35h A1080 2023/20 2 ) and also the Bavarian Data Protection Commissioner stated to have no concerns after presentation of the study protocol ( reference number : DSB/7 692/1 275 ) . The results of the case control study will be presented at national as well as international conferences and be published in the form of scientific articles in peer reviewed journals .

Corn silage ( CS ) is a cornerstone component in dairy cattle diets , contributing up to 50% of the total dietary NEL intake . Selecting high quality CS hybrids is critical for improving production efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint of dairy operations . The rumen fermentable organic matter index ( RFOMI ) assesses CS nutritional quality , with a focus on rumen fermentable NDF ( RFNDF ) and starch ( RFST ) , which together account for the majority of digestible silage OM . The objective was to evaluate the effects of feeding CS with similar RFOMI but varying RFST and RFNDF contents on lactational performance , enteric gas emissions , nutrient digestibility , and nitrogen utilization in dairy cows . Rumen fermentable NDF and RFST were determined using established in vitro and in situ methods , incorporating digestibility coefficients and nutrient fraction analyses . A total of 48 mid lactation Holstein cows ( 16 primiparous , 32 multiparous ) were used in this study . Post ensiling RFST to RFNDF ratios ( RFST : RFNDF ) in CS were used for treatment designation . The study was a randomized complete block design where cows within a block were randomly assigned to treatment diets . The diets were fed as TMR and contained 50% CS ( dietary DM basis ) with RFST : RFNDF of 62 , 85 , 92 , or Animal performance and enteric gas emissions were evaluated using polynomial linear or quadratic effects of postfermentation CS RFST : RFNDF ratios . A quadratic effect of treatment on DMI was observed , where cows fed CS with the lowest RFST : RFNDF ratio resulted in the greatest DMI . Dairy cows fed CS with an increasing RFST : RFNDF ratio tended to have increased milk yield , but no effects were observed on ECM yield . Increasing RFST : RFNDF of CS in the diet increased quadratically feed and ECM feed efficiencies , CH emission yield ( as g/kg DMI ) , and total tract DM and OM digestibilities . These results indicated that feeding CS with RFST : RFNDF ratios within 85 to 92 , when compared with CS hybrids outside that range of RFST : RFNDF , at 50% of dietary DM , may promote a reduction in DMI but increase feed and ECM feed efficiencies andCH yield by enhancing apparent total tract DM digestibility in lactating dairy cows .
The daily rise and fall in ambient temperature caused by Earth ' s 24 hour rotation may help regulate circadian rhythms in visually impaired individuals . In all mammals , circadian rhythms , the daily cycles of physiology and behavior , are time controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) , the brain ' s central clock . The SCN typically synchronizes circadian rhythms with the light/dark cycle through photoentrainment , a process in which specialized retinal cells capture ambient light and transmit this information to the SCN , allowing it to set its phase . Without light input , the rodent SCN ' s light driven circuits can become desynchronized , potentially allowing alternative entrainment signals , such as ambient temperature , to influence central timing . Here , we consider whether a similar mechanism could benefit visually impaired humans who , due to retinal damage , have reduced or absent photic input to the central clock . Visually impaired individuals often experience circadian misalignment , whereby internal rhythms drift out of synchrony with the light dark cycle , and we suggest that temperature information may mitigate some of this drift . Temperature entrainment could operate through heat shock pathways from the skin , via thermoregulatory brain regions with reciprocal connections to the SCN , or by shifting core body temperature through warm or cold baths , which can alter the phase of clocks in peripheral organs and potentially feedback to adjust central time . Given that temperature is a weaker cue than light , it remains unknown if , and to what extent , it may significantly impact central timing . However , if effective , temperature entrainment in the visually impaired could potentially improve circadian disorders , poor sleep , and adverse health outcomes associated with circadian dysfunction including depression , cognitive decline , and metabolic disorders , which are more prevalent in this population . Research is needed to confirm the long term effectiveness of temperature as an entrainment cue in the visually impaired population , which may have broader implications for circadian timekeeping in mammals and the role of temperature in the absence of light .

It demonstrated excellent performance in predicting progression free survival ( C index = 69 ) and OS ( C index = 72 ) , outperforming the clinical risk score alone in both internal and external validations . CONCLUSION : The C reactive protein to albumin ratio is an effective independent predictor for patients with colorectal liver metastasis receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy . The clinical prediction model exhibited superior predictive ability , potentially improving individualized treatment decisions patients with colorectal liver metastasis .
BACKGROUND : Thiram is a fungicide widely used to protect crops from pest , and facile and efficient methods are of profound important for on site monitoring of thiram to ensure food safety and human health . Among the reported methods , colorimetric methods based on nanozymes show a great potential . RESULTS : A facile " turn on " colorimetric platform was constructed for on site monitoring of thiram in vegetable and fruit samples based on the bioinspired copper doped COP ( Cu@COP ) . By mimicking the catalytic active site of laccase , Cu@COP displayed excellent laccase like activity and could catalyze the 4 aminoantipyrine ( 4 AP ) mediated chromogenic reaction to form wine red product after 1 h . With the addition of thiram , however , the S S bond of thiram was cleaved by Cu@COP and new thiram Cu@COP complexes formed with the result of enhancing the laccase like activity of Cu@COP , and the wine red product was quickly observed within 5 min . Based on the color changes and characteristic absorption at 510 nm , a reliable colorimetric platform was constructed for on site monitoring of thiram . The present Cu@COP based colorimetric method had high selectivity successfully determined the concentrations of thiram in Mango , Cabbage and Lake water samples with the recoveries ranging from 6 to 5 % . The determined thiram concentrations in fruit and vegetable samples were also well agreed with those obtained by standard LC MS/MS method , implying that the present method had high accuracy in complex samples . SIGNIFICANCE : The present work not only synthesized a new Cu@COP with excellent laccase like activity and high stability , but also developed a reliable colorimetric method for thiram detection in vegetable and fruit samples , which shows a great promising in on site monitoring of thiram residues in real samples to ensure the food safety and human health .
BACKGROUND : Self crosslinked poly ( ionic liquid ) s ( CPIs ) , a subset of ionic liquids , are emerging functional polymeric materials with broad applications in catalysis and sensor technology . However , there are scant reports on the use of CPIs as high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) stationary phases . Fluorinated materials , noted for their unique physicochemical properties , have recently drawn interest in purification and separation fields . RESULTS : In this work , self crosslinked poly ( ionic liquid ) s were first employed to prepare a stationary phase ( Sil CPIs ) for HPLC , and fluorine functionalization ( Sil CPIs F ) was achieved with 1H , 1H , 2H , 2H heptadecafluorodecyl acrylate ( PFOEA ) . The impact of chromatographic conditions on retention demonstrated that both Sil CPIs and Sil CPIs F could operate in a multimodal manner , with various analytes ( including nucleobases , organic acids , and sulfonamide drugs ) being effectively separated under different modes . Outstanding repeatability ( RSD </=67 % ) and column efficiency ( 127 , 010 plates/m ) were attained . Fluorine functionalization enhanced the separation performance of the poly ( ionic liquid ) s stationary phase , endowing it with superior selectivity and separation efficiency towards phenolic isomers and complex samples . Thermodynamic investigations revealed the differences in the retention mechanisms of Sil CPIs and Sil CPIs F , while the linear solvation energy relationship ( LSER ) more specifically indicated that fluorine modification intensified dipole dipole interaction and hydrophobic effect of Sil CPIs . The column with better performance was used to detect chlorpheniramine maleate in pediatric cold medicine and dehydroacetic acid in 6 food samples ( including bread , dessert , pastry , instant noodle seasoning packet , fruit and vegetable juice , and pickled turnip ) , with recovery rate ranging from 4 % to 67 % , meeting the detection requirements for actual samples . SIGNIFICANCE : This study confirms the modifiability of self crosslinked poly ( ionic liquid ) s stationary phase with 3D reticulated structures , and demonstrates that the introduction of fluorinated monomer can enhance the comprehensive separation capabilities of Sil CPIs . The potential application value of Sil CPIs F in the analysis of multi component samples and actual detection has been highlighted .
BACKGROUND : The senescence associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) is closely linked to aging by promoting inflammation and tissue degradation . Sensing SASP is crucial for early detection of and intervention in age related diseases to enhance therapeutic outcomes . Herein , SASP selective sensors ( transforming growth factor [TGF] beta1 and interleukin [IL] 6 probes ) were designed by utilizing TGF beta1/IL 6 aptamers functionalized copper immobilized polymer dots that promoted specific binding between TGF beta1/IL 6 aptamers on the probe surface with aging factors ( TGF beta1 and IL 6 ) . RESULTS : The selective binding was reflected by changes in the conductivity of the probes . The TGF beta1 and IL 6 probes showed high sensitivity towards TGF beta1 and IL 6 , with limits of detection of 09 pg/mL for the TGF beta1 ( R = 9989 ) and 49 pg/mL ( R = 9998 ) for IL 6 probes . In vitro study using senescent cells confirmed that the probes could selectively detect TGF beta1 and IL 6 , indicated by increased resistance with longer incubation times ( TGF beta1 ( 72h ) = 775 MOmega , IL 6 ( 72h ) = 401 MOmega ) . Furthermore , the TGF beta1 and IL 6 probes exhibited excellent detection performance in in vivo samples from aging mouse models when monitoring the levels of TGF beta1 and IL 6 at different times after lenti soup injection and at different mouse ages ( 6 20 months ) . Additionally , the electrical signals generated during sensing can be displayed on a smartphone via a wireless sensing system . SIGNIFICANCE : TGF beta1 and IL 6 probes provide a sensitive , specific and accessible diagnostic platform for senescence aging factors monitoring , which are expected to be an essential tool that transforms the analysis of aging and age related diseases .
LIMK1 is a promising therapeutic target for multiple pathologies . Its holistic study seems crucial , as none of its inhibitors has passed clinical trials . The need for new fluorescent probes for the study of enzyme/ligand interactions is always increasing with the development of new analytical tools . A method for the assessment of LIMK activity directly in cell lysate is needed to ensure that interaction studies can be performed close to native conditions and by using active enzymes . Here , we introduce a study of LIM Kinase activity and inhibition monitored directly in cell lysate by capillary electrophoresis ( CE ) . The miRFP670 LIMK1 was prepared because it is a fluorescent fusion protein emitting in the red spectrum and is thus suitable for microscale thermophoresis ( MST ) affinity assays . A PDADMAC coated capillary was mandatory to avoid adsorption issues . The results directly confirm , for the first time , that miRFP670 LIMK1 is still active in the cell lysate even when the miRFP670 fluorescent tag is attached to its C terminal . The inhibition of miRFP670 LIMK1 activity in the presence of TH 257 was also confirmed by CE . The dissociation constant , K ( d ) , of the interaction miRFP670 LIMK1/TH 257 was then evaluated by MST , again directly in the cell lysate without any purification step . Submicromolar cellular on target activity was revealed ( K ( d ) = 9 nM ) , confirming that TH 257 is suitable as a chemical probe for LIMK This study presents an innovative application of CE as a direct approach to verify , in a straightforward and simple manner , without purification or radioactivity , if an enzymatic target maintains its functionality after labeling . This work also highlights the complementarity of CE and MST in advancing pharmaceutical development under conditions that closely mimic those in vivo .
BACKGROUND : Protein immobilization method play a pivotal role in developing affinity chromatographic assays for both basic and applied research , and site specific , covalent attachment serves as the most desirable strategy . Traditional strategy often gives rise to inconsistent results due to the use of heterobifunctional cross linker or a similar two step protocol . Introducing unnatural amino acids into the immobilization is possible to address the issue , however , it needs purification of the protein whereas suffers from loss of the protein activity . Herein , this work developed a method by integrating a thiol ene addition click reaction during the protein expression for preparation of immobilized protein . RESULTS : The methodology involved the genetically incorporated O allyl l tyrosine ( O ALTyr ) into serotonin transporter ( SERT ) and norepinephrine transporter ( NET ) , the fusion proteins were immobilized onto silica gel through " thiol ene " click reaction . The activities of the immobilized proteins were verified by surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) measurement with high success rates of 4 % for immobilized SERT and 8 % for immobilized NET . The stability and repeatability of immobilized proteins were quantified by determination of protein drug binding parameters by affinity chromatography under diverse conditions including extreme pHs ( pH = 0 0 ) and high concentrations of denature reagents ( 5 % 20 % for DMSO and 5 % 40 % for methanol ) . Finally , screening analysis found that crocin I and n butylphthalide were dual target compounds binding to SERT and NET in Gardenia jasminoides Ellis Rhizoma Ligustici Chuanxiong Hort ( GR ) extract . The accuracy of the chromatographic screening method was validated by determined the regulation of the two compounds on release of neurotransmitters including 5 HT , NE , and DA , as well as the expression of the SERT and NET . SIGNIFICANCE : This efficient , purification free , site specific , and one step immobilization method proved to yield immobilized protein with highly enhanced stability and reproducibility which is possible to be used in challenging systems , especially affinity chromatographic analysis using mobile phase containing organic solvents . It benefits analysis of interaction between protein and drugs with low water solubility , thereby having potential for strengthening the role of immobilized protein based methods in many fields like drug discovery and fabricating other protein surface to pursue improved assay performance .
BACKGROUND : Ferroptosis is an iron dependent programmed cell death pathway driven by lipid peroxidation that involves various inflammation related diseases and even cancer , which is often accompanied by the accumulation of mitochondrial ROS . HClO , as one of the vital ROS in organisms , is mainly derived from the mitochondria of cells . And abnormal levels of HClO can disrupt redox homeostasis in cells and lead to various diseases . Importantly , intracellular HClO levels are also associated with ferroptosis . Therefore , it is very important to study the fluctuation of intracellular HClO level during ferroptosis . RESULTS : Herein , a HClO fluorescent probe TPA ClO was synthesized using triphenylamine fluorophore and benzothiadiazole structure . Notably , TPA ClO exhibited the advantages of NIR fluorescence emission , good AIE properties and large Stokes shift , and which could selectively detect HClO with a detection limit of 0 nM . TPA ClO could be well targeted in mitochondria and had been successfully applied to monitor exogenous and endogenous HClO in MCF7 cells . Moreover , the imaging experiment of TPA ClO indicated that erastin and RSL3 induced ferroptosis in MCF7 cells led to increased levels of mitochondrial HClO and that MCF7 cells showed high ferroptosis sensitivity to RSL SIGNIFICANCE : TPA ClO exhibited high selectivity to HClO over other potential interfering substances , and could be employed to monitor HClO level fluctuations in MCF7 cells . More importantly , TPA ClO could be an effective tool to monitor the fluctuations of HClO level in mitochondria during ferroptosis as well as for investigating various diseases associated with ferroptosis for future research .
BACKGROUND : Acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) not only serves as an important biomarker for nervous system diseases , but also facilitates the discovery of related drugs . Therefore , the sensitive and accurate detection of AChE is of great significance for the diagnosis of relevant diseases and drug screening . Moreover , despite the great leaps in nanozyme based sensing technology , it is still one of the challenges in the biomimetic field to design felicitous approaches to realize in situ modulation of nanozyme activity . To address the above issues , a proton modulated strategy for self regulation of nanozyme activity was proposed , and then AChE was employed as a model analyte to construct a dual mode colorimetric and electrochemical bioassay system . RESULTS : In this work , a novel nanozyme ( 7 % hemin BiWO , H BiWO ) with specific peroxidase like ( POD ) activity was exploited , which can activate 3 , 3 ' , 5 , 5 ' tetramethylbenzidine ( TMB ) to produce oxTMB in the coexistence of hydrogen peroxide ( HO ) . Whereas the latter ( oxTMB ) exhibits attractive optical yet electrochemical properties , thus leading to remarkable signal enhancement . In addition , in situ regulation of nanozyme catalytic performance was achieved based on the fact that AChE could promote the hydrolysis of acetylcholine ( ACh ) to produce acetic acid , and then directly affect the pH of the solution . Thus , a self modulated colorimetric and electrochemical dual channel sensing strategy based on AChE activity was prepared , which not only allows quantitative analysis of AChE with detection limits of 04 mU/mL ( colorimetric method ) and 015 mU/mL ( electrochemical method ) , but also successfully fulfil determination in spiked human blood samples with the recovery values ranging from 44 % to 66 % . SIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY : Overall , a colorimetric electrochemical dual channel sensor based on the proton regulation mechanism was constructed , which satisfied the " on demand " determination of AChE , but also reached in situ modulation of the catalytic activity of nanozyme . This study opens up a new avenue for the establishment of a self regulating dual mode analytical approach , and also provides new impetus for developing novel diagnostic methods of AChE related diseases .
Pseudo nitzschia multiseries is a diatom known for producing domoic acid ( DA ) , a neurotoxin that can cause Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning ( ASP ) , which poses risks to both marine life and human health . This study reports the first detailed investigation of P . multiseries in the Sea of Marmara , focusing on its morphology , phylogeny , and toxin production . Morphological analysis using light and electron microscopy confirmed key diagnostic features consistent with P . multiseries . Phylogenetic analysis , focusing on ITS and LSU gene sequences , showed a close genetic relationship between the Turkish strain and other strains of P . multiseries . Domoic acid levels , quantified using LC MS/MS during exponential and stationary growth phases , ranged between 46 and 24 pg cell ( 1 ) , with minor amounts of isoDA ( A , D and E ) also detected . These findings highlight the importance of monitoring P . multiseries in Turkish coastal waters due to its significant potential for DA production . This study provides valuable insights into the morphology , phylogeny , and toxin production of P . multiseries , as well as its potential implications for management of marine resources and public health protection . It offers a comprehensive examination of this potentially toxic diatom species in Turkish coastal waters .
Microcystis aeruginosa is considered a harmful cyanobacterial species due to its ability to produce microcystins ( MCs ) and its increasing prevalence in estuarine environments . While previous studies have demonstrated the effects of individual environmental factors on either growth or toxin content of M . aeruginosa , potential interactive effects and resulting changes in its toxicity remain unclear . In this study , we first conducted an orthogonally designed growth experiment to assess potential effects of changes in temperature , salinity , pH , and nutrient conditions . Subsequently , we performed a full factorial growth experiment focusing on temperature and salinity as key variables . Intracellular and extracellular MCs content , as well as phycocyanin levels , were measured during both exponential and stationary growth phases . Toxicity was further evaluated based on mortality and swimming behavior of the epibenthic copepod Nitokra spinipes and the planktonic copepod Acartia tonsa . Results showed that both growth rate and MCs content significantly increased with temperature ( from 15 to 28 degrees C ) but decreased with higher salinity ( from 8 to 16 ppt ) . Moreover , cell density was significantly correlated with both intracellular and extracellular MCs contents . A significant interaction between temperature and salinity was observed . No correlation was found between intracellular MCs and phycocyanin contents . Finally , exposure to M . aeruginosa resulted in decreased swimming speed , increased inactivity , and higher mortality in A . tonsa , compared to the non toxic Rhodomonas salina . Our study highlights the consequences of temperature and salinity on M . aeruginosa growth and toxin production , offering increased insights into the potential ecotoxicological risks of future blooms .
Harmful algal blooms ( HABs ) , driven by warming oceans and increased eutrophication , are negatively affecting aquatic ecosystems as well as human health . Blooms of diatom Pseudo nitzschia spp . produce a neurotoxin , domoic acid ( DA ) , which can be concentrated by filter feeders , including shellfish . Consumption of DA contaminated seafood causes amnesic shellfish poisoning . DA causes well established effects on neurons , inducing neurotoxicity by binding to ionotropic glutamate receptors . However , its effects on non neuronal cells including microglia , the resident immune cells in the brain , are less well understood . Microglia play critical roles in brain health , and disruptions in microglial activity during development can have long term impacts on brain function and disease risk . The objective of this study was to examine the effects of developmental DA exposure on microglia using zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) . We characterized effects of DA exposure on microglial abundance and morphology at two developmental stages ( 2 and 4 days post fertilization ( dpf ) ) . We additionally assessed impacts on cell death , cytokine expression , and startle response behavior . In older larvae ( 4 dpf ) , microglial effects occurred only at the highest dose ( 3 ng DA per larvae ) and coincided with severe morphological defects . In contrast , 2 dpf exposure to lower doses ( 1 ng DA per embryo ) caused transient tremors without gross abnormalities but exposure to either 1 or 3 ng DA per larvae increased microglial abundance and altered microglial morphology . In contrast , 4 dpf exposure to 3 ng DA per larvae reduced microglial numbers . Increases in mRNA levels of il1b , il4 , and tgfb were observed after 4 dpf exposure , but no significant cytokine changes were detected at 2 dpf . Overall , the effects of DA are highly developmental stage specific , with microglial reactivity occurring at doses that do not cause gross morphological changes . These findings suggest that neuroinflammation may arise at lower DA doses , indicating a potential mechanism for subtle toxic effects and emphasizing the need for further research to better understand the consequences of low dose DA exposure on microglial function .
Rhamnogalacturonan I type pectin polysaccharide from wolfberry has immunity activity , but its intestinal immunity activity and structure activity relationship in the small intestine was still unclear . This study comparatively investigated the intestinal immune activity of wolfberry derived high and low branched Rhamnogalacturonan I type pectin polysaccharides ( H LBP and L LBP ) and explored the interaction mechanism with mechanical barrier . In the normal mechanical barrier model , both H LBP and L LBP could cross mechanical barrier with transport rates of 2 % and 25 % , thereby directly enhancing macrophage viability and phagocytic ability after crossing the mechanical barrier . The transport mechanism of H LBP in mechanical barrier included the clathrin and caveolin mediated pathways . In the damaged mechanical barrier model , H LBP could significantly enhance mechanical barrier integrity , reduce the production of neurotransmitter ( NO ) and inflammatory cytokine ( TNF alpha ) , thereby exerting indirectly intestinal immune activity . Transcriptome analysis showed that the interaction mechanism between H LBP and damaged mechanical barrier mainly involved signaling pathway regulating cell growth and survival ( PI3K AKT ) . Western blot experiment and molecular docking simulation confirmed that H LBP could reduce the expression of p PI3K , p AKT and cleaved Caspase H LBP had stronger directly and indirectly intestinal immune activity than L LBP . These findings were useful for the application of H LBP in improving intestinal immunity oral formulations .
Galactose rich polysaccharides from Ganoderma lucidum have emerged as promising immunomodulatory agents , yet their structural characteristics and mechanisms of action remain poorly understood . Here , we isolated and characterized a novel galactose rich polysaccharide ( GLP 1b , 79 kDa ) from Ganoderma lucidum . The analysis revealed a unique structure comprising an alpha 1 , 6 linked galactan backbone with C 2/C 3 acetylation , and complex branching with diverse terminal residues including T alpha L Fuc ( 4 OAc ) , T alpha D Man , and T alpha D Glc . In vitro studies demonstrated that GLP 1b enhanced macrophage function through TLR4 dependent activation of NF kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways , resulting in increased NO production and pro inflammatory cytokine secretion . In a cyclophosphamide induced immunosuppression mouse model , GLP 1 administration significantly restored immune homeostasis by normalizing CD4 ( + ) /CD8 ( + ) T cell ratios , elevating CD19 ( + ) B cell percentages , enhancing immunoglobulin production , and maintaining intestinal barrier integrity . Analyses revealed concurrent changes in immune parameters , gut microbiota composition ( including Lactobacillus and Alistipes populations ) , and metabolic profiles Metabolomics identified key changes in immune supportive metabolites , including phospholipids and TCA cycle intermediates , as well as modulation of bile acid pathways . These findings demonstrate that GLP 1b exhibits immunomodulatory activities both in vitro and in vivo , with immune effects that coincide with changes in gut microbiota and host metabolism . These observations provide insights for developing polysaccharide based immunotherapeutics .
Effective water management is essential for addressing high temperature ( HT ) challenges to rice quality . This study explored whether a controlled moderate soil drying ( MD ) regime could serve as a viable alternative to the conventional well watered ( WW ) regime in mitigating the effects of HT stress on rice quality . Two rice varieties were cultivated under normal temperature and HT conditions and subjected to the WW and MD regimes during the grain filling period . Findings revealed that HT stress significantly compromised rice quality . However , under HT conditions , the MD regime proved more effective than the WW regime in maintaining plant water homeostasis and enhancing photosynthesis . This improvement not only facilitated the accumulation of nonstructural carbohydrates in the grains but also boosted the activity of key starch synthesizing enzymes , leading to a marked increase in starch accumulation . Specifically , under HT stress , the MD regime significantly enhanced the milling and appearance quality of rice ; for instance , the head rice rates of Jinxiangyu 1 and Yangdao 6 increased by 6 % and 7 % while their chalkiness degrees decreased by 2 % and 8 % , respectively . Moreover , the MD regime contributed to the stabilization of starch molecular structure and functional properties , thereby further alleviating the negative impacts of HT stress on rice quality .
This study investigates the influence of weakly polar methoxy groups and nonpolar carbon carbon double bonds in phenolic acids ( PAs ) on the physicochemical characteristics and digestibility of cassava starch ( CS ) using vanillic acid ( VA ) , syringic acid ( SA ) , ferulic acid ( FA ) , and sinapic acid ( EA ) . Both methoxy groups and carbon carbon double bonds are shown to modify molecular phase distributions , reduce the energy gap ( DeltaE ) , and increase electron localization . These changes enhance the overall hydrophobicity and activity of PAs , thereby enhancing their ability to bind with starch and form hydrogen bonds . Additionally , methoxy groups and carbon‑carbon double bonds can enhance the crystallinity of the complex , reduce gelatinization viscosity , improve thermal stability , and reduce digestibility . Notably , EA , with the most methoxy groups and carbon carbon double bonds , exhibits the lowest DeltaE ( 9105 eV ) , the highest resistant starch content ( 79 +/ 60 % ) , and the most significant reduction in glycemic index ( GI ) ( 52 +/ 54 % ) . Finally , carbon carbon double bonds demonstrate a more pronounced effect than methoxy groups in improving the physicochemical properties and digestibility of starch , confirming the substantial potential of nonpolar molecular groups in improving starch characteristics . These findings provide valuable insights for starch modification techniques and the development of low GI food products .
This study aimed to construct a ready to use , two syringe mixing ( TM ) system comprising free flowing drug aggregates with deaggregating and uniformly embeddable polysaccharide solutions as a new approach for long acting parenteral delivery . Rotigotine ( RG ) and donepezil ( DP ) , approved for the treatment of Parkinson ' s and Alzheimer ' s diseases , respectively , were employed as model compounds . For syringe filling , free flowing drug aggregates were engineered using ordered mixing , adhering pulverized RG ( 1 +/ 3 mum ) or DP particles ( 8 +/ 2 mum ) to hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone K17 particles ( 120 to 150 mum ) . Drug aggregates were effectively deaggregated and distributed as individual fine drug particles in hyaluronate ( HA ) or carboxymethyl cellulose ( CMC ) matrices via electrostatic interactions during TM process . TM systems of RG with HA or CMC and DP with HA provided extended drug release with decreased in vivo spread following subcutaneous injection . TM systems of RG and DP provided protracted pharmacokinetic profiles over 4 weeks with decreased initial exposure compared to drug suspensions and even profiles comparable to those of biodegradable polymer based in situ forming implants ( ISFI ) . Moreover , RG loaded HA or CMC TM systems alleviated the local inflammation compared to the ISFI . Therefore , this polysaccharide based TM system is expected to serve as a simple and effective long acting delivery system for water insoluble therapeutic agents .
Starch biosynthesis , breakdown , and multi scale leaf starch granule structure in the potato variety Wotan with knock out of the Granular Bound Starch Synthase ( GBSS ) I gene were assessed . In wild type , starch in the leaves had compared to the tuber significantly lower amylose content , smaller amylopectin molecules , more amylopectin side chains with a degree of polymerization ( DP ) of 6 12 , fewer amylopectin sidechains ( DP 12 24 ) , higher degree of branching , thicker amorphous lamellae , higher crystallinity , higher molecular order , and much smaller granules . Knock out of GBSSI resulted in reduced leaf starch amylose content and larger amylopectin and amylose molecules , more amylopectin sidechains ( DP 6 8 and 12 16 ) , fewer internal chains ( DP 18 24 ) , increased branching , thickening of the crystalline lamellae , lowered crystallinity and increased molecular order . Leaf starch content assayed over 24 h with a diurnal rhythm of 16/8 h ( light/dark ) revealed that the gbssI mutant accumulated leaf starch at a faster rate , while degrading leaf starch at a much slower rate compared to wild type . This study provides a systematic analysis of the multi scale structure of leaf starch in potato and is the first study to demonstrate that the loss of GBSSI causes significant structural differences in leaf starch while also affecting leaf starch synthesis and degradation .
The principal disease impacting pepper production is Phytophthora blight , which nano‑selenium ( nano Se ) controls well but has high storage requirements and low heat resistance . Varying pectin amounts yielded pectin modified nano Se ( nano Se@PT ) with 1 % , 5 % , 1 % , and 2 % concentration . As pectin content grew , nano Se@PT particle size reduced , zeta potential value rose , and thermogravimetric temperature climbed . The incorporation of nano Se@PT can improve its stability and thermal resistance at 40 degrees C and 70 degrees C . Nano Se@PT outperformed nano Se in fungicidal and Phytophthora capsici inhibition . In vitro antifungal experiments showed that nano Se@PT could significantly inhibit mycelium growth with an EC of about 4 mg/L . The particles adsorbed on the surface of mycelium , inducing death by destroying cell membranes , mitochondria , and nuclei . Non targeted metabolomics analysis showed that nano Se@PT treatment disrupted the mycelium growth and metabolism and changed amino acids , nucleotides , and sugar levels . In vivo experiments , 2 % nano Se@PT had the lowest disease index and the best preventive therapy . Rhizosphere soil microbial analysis showed that nano Se@PT recruited beneficial microorganisms such as Bacteroides , Lactobacillus , and Bifidobacterium in pepper plants , improving their Phytophthora capsici resistance and growth . The findings suggest that nano Se@PT might be a unique pepper disease control technique and shed light on plant fungal disease management .

In this study , porous poly ( lactic co glycolic acid ) ( PLGA ) microspheres loaded with ginseng polysaccharides were successfully prepared and used to ameliorate pneumonia in mice . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , and confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed the successful preparation of porous PLGA microspheres loaded with neutral ginseng polysaccharides ( GP N ) and acidic ginseng polysaccharides ( GP S ) . Porous PLGA microspheres loaded with GP N and GP S had good release profiles . In vitro tests revealed that the release solution of porous PLGA microspheres loaded with GP N and GP S was nontoxic . The release solutions of porous PLGA microspheres loaded with GP N and GP S can both effectively reduce tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) , interleukin ( IL ) 6 , and IL 1beta . Porous PLGA microspheres loaded with GP N and GP S ameliorated mouse pneumonia by modulating cytokine levels and antioxidant enzyme activities . Porous microspheres loaded with GP S exhibited more potent anti inflammatory effects than those loaded with GP N . This phenomenon may be attributed to the presence of uronic acid in the GP S . Transcriptomics revealed that the potential anti pneumonia mechanism of porous PLGA microspheres loaded with GP S may ameliorate pneumonia in mice through cytochrome P450 drug metabolism , arachidonic acid metabolism , and MAPK signaling pathways . These findings provide a theoretical basis for the amelioration of pneumonia using ginseng polysaccharides .
Gastric ulcers are refractory wounds that pose a significant clinical challenge , underscoring the urgent need for effective and affordable therapeutic strategies . In this study , we purified a novel homogeneous astragalus polysaccharide ( APS13 ) and elucidated its structure , which consists of a >4 ) alpha 1 , 4 Glc ( 1 > backbone with glucose branches at the 6 position , as determined by 2D NMR and glycosyl residue analysis . To enhance its tissue adhesion and drug release profile , APS13 was co assembled with glycyrrhizic acid ( GA ) into a GA APS hydrogel . The resulting hydrogel exhibited strong adhesion and prolonged gastric retention under acidic conditions . In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that the GA APS hydrogel reduced ulcer area , improved mucosal integrity , and decreased apoptosis related protein expression in a rat model of acute gastric ulcer . Comparative analyses showed enhanced therapeutic outcomes relative to treatment with GA or APS13 alone . Proteomic and cellular experiments further indicated that the hydrogel ' s protective effect is associated with attenuation of ROS induced apoptosis . These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of APS13 based hydrogels and offer a natural material strategy for addressing oxidative stress related gastric injury .
Sugammadex is the first cyclodextrin based API with a well known mechanism of action , result of a rational drug design and development . It is a gamma cyclodextrin derivative , substituted only on the primary hydroxyl groups , resulting a single isomer and a symmetric molecule . Due to the complex synthetic and purification procedures , currently there are more than a dozen of identified and characterized process related impurities . As the patent held by the originator ( Merck & Co . , Inc . ) approaches expiration globally , generic manufacturers are likely to develop alternative synthetic pathways , which may lead to an increase in the number of impurities . Mapping and characterizing the impurity profile of Sugammadex is therefore essential to ensure patient safety and maintain drug efficacy . In this paper , we have identified and characterized a novel impurity formed through the oxidation and side chain cleavage of the sulfide bond .
Obesity is increasingly recognized not only for its systemic health impacts but also for its association with visual defects and eye diseases . This chapter explores the relationship between obesity and ocular health , highlighting the mechanisms by which metabolic dysregulation influences visual outcomes . Obesity exacerbates risk factors such as hypertension , dyslipidemia , and insulin resistance , which compromise retinal and optic nerve health . Conditions like diabetic retinopathy , age related macular degeneration , and glaucoma are discussed in the context of obesity related inflammation , oxidative stress , and altered vascular function , focusing on the retina as one of the body ' s most metabolically demanding tissues . Key pathways include adipose derived cytokines that disrupt retinal homeostasis , and the effects of insulin resistance on retinal cells and vasculature . Furthermore , this chapter covers emerging evidence on the advances of genetic factors linking diabetic retinopathy to retinal impairments . By elucidating these interactions , we aim to provide insight into preventive and therapeutic strategies that could mitigate vision loss among individuals with obesity .
Genetics is a significant risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes , with a family history conferring a 5 3 fold increased risk . Intriguingly , this heritable risk is higher when the affected parent is the mother , suggesting a potential role of mitochondrial genetics maternally inherited DNA in diabetes pathogenesis , a hypothesis this chapter will explore . While obesity mediates some of the genetic risk of type 2 diabetes , the chapter and will focus on genetic influences on diabetes independent of obesity . Mechanistically , genetic variants directly or indirectly contribute to insulin resistance across key tissues , including liver , muscle and adipose tissue . This insulin resistance prevents the liver from efficiently suppressing glucose production in response to insulin and impairs glucose uptake in muscle during postprandial states . Insulin resistance is driven by complex interactions between the genome and environmental , which can , in turn , influence gene expression and contribute to worsening of metabolic dysfunction . This chapter examines how tissue specific genetic changes drive insulin resistance in individual organs and how these localized dysfunctions contribute to the broader , multi organ metabolic dysfunction that characterize type 2 diabetes .
Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and nonmotor dysfunctions . Its pathological hallmark is the aggregation of a synuclein in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , leading to widespread loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra ( SN ) . Interestingly , metabolic disorders localized in the periphery , such as diabetes mellitus , frequently co occur with PD . Emerging evidence highlights a bidirectional relationship : metabolic diseases may accelerate PD progression , while PD can exacerbate metabolic dysfunction . Beyond these associations , a growing body of research suggests that dysfunction in the peripheral nervous system , the primary communication bridge between the brain and peripheral organs , plays a critical role in these comorbidities . Autonomic nerve perturbation may accelerate dopaminergic neuronal loss in the SN and exacerbate metabolic dysregulation . This chapter synthesizes current evidence linking autonomic dysfunction with the progression of PD and related metabolic disorders , and it explores innovative therapeutic strategies leveraging this bidirectional relationship to address PD progression .
Thermoregulation is a fundamental biological process that allows birds and mammals to maintain a stable internal temperature despite environmental fluctuations , a mechanism shaped by millions of years of evolution . Non shivering thermogenesis ( NST ) , primarily driven by brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) , plays a central role in thermoregulation by not only helping maintain energy homeostasis but also influencing broader metabolic and physiological processes . Recent research has revealed that BAT thermogenesis is regulated by peripheral hormones and at a central level , with key hypothalamic energy sensing pathways such as AMP activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress playing critical roles . Beyond its metabolic functions , BAT and NST have emerged as important contributors to tumor biology , offering novel therapeutic strategies for metabolic and oncological diseases . This review explores the intricate mechanisms underpinning NST , including UCP1 dependent thermogenesis and alternative pathways such as creatine cycling , calcium dependent thermogenesis , and lipid cycling . Emerging evidence further highlights BAT ' s potential in to modulate tumor metabolism , with pharmacological and genetic approaches showing promise in reshaping the tumor microenvironment . This growing body of knowledge offers exciting prospects for targeting BAT thermogenesis in treating obesity and other metabolic diseases .
Food cravings , an intense desire to consume specific foods , are a complex interplay of cognitive , emotional , behavioral , physiological , and cultural factors . Although prevalent across genders , food cravings are more frequent and intense in women , with hormonal fluctuations particularly during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy playing a significant role . Pregnancy , marked by profound hormonal and physiological shifts , often heightens cravings , likely as a response to the increased metabolic needs of both mother and fetus . However , the tendency to crave high calorie , palatable foods during this time can lead to excessive weight gain , presenting potential risks to both maternal and fetal health . This chapter examines the neural mechanisms underlying altered eating behaviors during pregnancy and their role in triggering food cravings . We discuss the health implications of disrupted eating patterns in pregnancy , emphasizing the need for further research to advance understanding of female specific neurobiology and to develop targeted interventions that support healthy eating behaviors , ultimately improving maternal and offspring health outcomes .
Omics technologies are transforming our understanding of disease mechanisms and reshaping clinical practice . By enabling high throughput , unbiased data collection at various molecular levels including genes ( genomics ) , mRNA ( transcriptomics ) , proteins ( proteomics ) , and metabolites ( metabolomics ) omics approaches offer a comprehensive view of biological states in both health and disease . Among these , metabolomics has emerged as a pivotal tool , rapidly evolving beyond diagnostics to become a cutting edge technique for pinpointing metabolites that regulate key physiological processes . This chapter reviews the advances in metabolomics , its integration with other omics approaches , and its applications , particularly emphasizing energy homeostasis . By incorporating metabolomic insights into physiology , we move closer to an integrative understanding of biological systems , laying the groundwork for novel therapies to combat obesity and related metabolic disorders .
Advancements in informatics , genetics , and neuroscience have greatly expanded our understanding of how the central nervous system ( CNS ) regulates energy balance and metabolism . This chapter explores the key neural circuits within the hypothalamus and brainstem that integrate behavioral and physiological processes to maintain metabolic homeostasis . It also examines the dynamic interplay between the CNS and peripheral organs , mediated through hormonal and neuronal signals , which fine tune appetite , energy expenditure , and body weight . Furthermore , we highlight groundbreaking research that unveils molecular and cellular pathways governing energy regulation , representing a new frontier in addressing obesity and metabolic disorders . Innovative approaches , such as neurogenetic and neuromodulation techniques , are explored as promising strategies for improving weight management and metabolic health . By providing a comprehensive perspective on the mechanisms underlying energy balance , this chapter underscores the transformative potential of emerging therapeutic innovations .
A twin child in early childhood presented with growth failure and multiple skeletal deformities involving both axial and appendicular skeleton . They did not have any upper limb deformity , fractures , dental anomalies , mental retardation , facial coarsening or organomegaly . The initial differentials were rickets , spondylo epiphyseal dysplasia , related dysplastic diseases and renal tubular acidosis ( RTA ) . Biochemical evaluations revealed mild normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with a positive urinary anion gap and prompted us to diagnose RTA based on those . However , their detailed skeletal imaging evaluations suggested dysostosis multiplex . With the suspicion of mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ) type IV , leucocyte N acetylgalactosamine 6 sulfate sulfatase ( GALNS ) enzyme evaluation was done along with whole exome sequencing , confirming our diagnosis . The integrating clinical history , physical examination , radiology and genetic confirmation underscores the complexity of diagnosing rare disorders like MPS IVA and highlights the need for a systematic and multidisciplinary approach .
Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours ( PMTs ) are rare neoplasms that secrete fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) , a hormone that disrupts phosphate homeostasis and induces tumour induced osteomalacia ( TIO ) . This condition causes hypophosphataemia , bone pain , fractures and musculoskeletal weakness . Due to the non specific nature of these symptoms , TIO is often misdiagnosed with treatment delays . Surgical resection of PMTs is curative with rapid normalisation of serum phosphorus and full symptom resolution . PMTs are often located in the extremities and axial skeleton but can also occur in less common areas such as the intrathoracic region . We report a case of an intrathoracic PMT in a young woman who suffered for over 2 years without a diagnosis . The PMT was identified on CT , MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and confirmed by histopathology . The tumour was excised via combined video assisted thoracoscopic surgery and posterior thoracic resection . Within 6 months , the patient experienced complete symptom resolution and normalised serum levels .
Infertility , affecting one in six couples worldwide , poses significant health and social challenges . While both male and female factors contribute to infertility , male infertility causes remain underexplored , with about 34% of cases classified as unexplained . A few studies focus on the role of lipids in male fertility , and some lipids are rising as key players in spermatozoa . This review highlights the importance of lipids , particularly phospholipids , neutral lipids , and glycolipids , in spermatozoa during capacitation and the acrosome reaction ( AR ) . The dynamic lipid profile of human spermatozoa is crucial for their development , maturation , and fertilization capability . During epididymal maturation , sperm undergo crucial biochemical changes , including increased production of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin , which enhance membrane integrity and mobility . Increased levels of ceramide affect membrane fluidity and signalling necessary for sperm function . As spermatozoa enter the female reproductive tract , they adjust their lipid content for capacitation and fertilization . Lipid signalling is crucial for human spermatozoa , influencing their viability and fertilization potential during transit through the female reproductive tract . Lysophosphatidic acid , abundant in seminal plasma , enhances sperm motility , facilitates the AR by promoting glycolysis and calcium influx , and is important for maintaining sperm viability . The remodelling of lipid rafts , enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids , is essential for signal transduction and capacitation . Sphingolipids , particularly sphingosine 1 phosphate and ceramide , play significant roles in sperm capacitation and AR by promoting reactive oxygen species production and calcium signalling , respectively . Understanding these lipid dynamics will increase our knowledge of the complexity of sperm metabolism .
BACKGROUND : Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) can be transmitted from mother to child either through transplacental infection or via blood to blood contact during or immediately after delivery . Early and accurate risk assessments are essential for guiding clinical decisions and implementing effective preventive measures . Data mining techniques are powerful tools for identifying key predictors in medical diagnostics . OBJECTIVE : This study aims to develop a robust predictive model for mother to child transmission ( MTCT ) of HBV using decision tree algorithms , specifically Iterative Dichotomiser 3 ( ID3 ) and classification and regression trees ( CART ) . The study identifies clinically and paraclinically relevant predictors , particularly hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) status and peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) concentration , for effective risk stratification and prevention . Additionally , we will assess the model ' s reliability and generalizability through cross validation with various training test split ratios , aiming to enhance its applicability in clinical settings and inform improved preventive strategies against HBV MTCT . METHODS : This study used decision tree algorithms ID3 and CART on a data set of 60 hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) positive pregnant women . Samples were collected either before or at the time of delivery , enabling the inclusion of patients who were undiagnosed or had limited access to treatment . We analyzed both clinical and paraclinical parameters , with a particular focus on HBeAg status and PBMC concentration . Additional biochemical markers were evaluated for their potential contributory or inhibitory effects on MTCT risk . The predictive models were validated using multiple training test split ratios to ensure robustness and generalizability . RESULTS : Our analysis showed that 20 out of 48 ( based on a split ratio of 8 from a total of 60 cases , 42% ) to 27 out of 57 ( based on a split ratio of 95 from a total of 60 cases , 47% ) training cases with HBeAg positive status were associated with a significant risk of MTCT of HBV ( chi=16 , P= . 007 , df=8 ) . Among HBeAg negative women , those with PBMC concentrations >/=8 x 10 cells/mL exhibited a low risk of MTCT , whereas individuals with PBMC concentrations <8 x 10 cells/mL demonstrated a negligible risk . Across all training test split ratios , the decision tree models consistently identified HBeAg status and PBMC concentration as the most influential predictors , underscoring their robustness and critical role in MTCT risk stratification . CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates that decision tree models are effective tools for stratifying the risk of MTCT of HBV by integrating key clinical and paraclinical markers . Among these , HBeAg status and PBMC concentration emerged as the most critical predictors . While the analysis focused on untreated patients , it provides a strong foundation for future investigations involving treated populations . These findings offer actionable insights to support the development of more targeted and effective HBV MTCT prevention strategies .
BACKGROUND : Continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) is increasingly being recognized as the new standard of care for glycemic monitoring in people with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . However , despite advances in therapeutics and technology , glycemic control remains suboptimal . Team based approaches involving pharmacists , particularly in primary care , have shown to be effective in addressing these shortcomings yet have not been rigorously evaluated in the literature . OBJECTIVE : Herein we present the protocol for a study that seeks to evaluate the change in hemoglobin A ( 1c ) ( HbA ( 1c ) ) in people with T2D using CGM under a pharmacist led approach as compared with a pharmacist led approach using no CGM ( only self monitoring blood glucose with a glucometer ) . We will also assess changes in CGM derived glycemic outcomes , health behavior , and safety outcomes among the pharmacist led CGM cohort . METHODS : This is a 12 week prospective cohort study in an academic family medicine department . We will enroll adults with T2D and a HbA ( 1c ) level of >/=8% . Participants in the intervention cohort will wear a CGM sensor ( FreeStyle Libre 2 ) for 12 weeks and receive structured diabetes self management education and support from a pharmacist . Each participant in the intervention group will have 5 visits with a pharmacist . The primary objective is the between group difference in change in HbA ( 1c ) levels from baseline to 12 weeks between the intervention and historical cohort . Secondary objectives include a change in CGM derived metrics among the intervention group from baseline to 12 weeks , and a change in health behavior via the Summary of Diabetes Self Care Activities measure from baseline to 12 weeks in the intervention cohort . A CGM survey will also be administered to participants in the intervention cohort to evaluate changes in diet , physical activity , general lifestyle , and medication adherence . Safety endpoints will also be evaluated . The primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed within and between groups using descriptive statistics , with a multivariable regression analysis conducted as appropriate to adjust for potential known confounding effects . RESULTS : This study was funded in July We began enrolling participants in December At the time of writing , 3 participants have been enrolled . It is anticipated that we will conclude this study in December 2025 and expect to disseminate results in March CONCLUSIONS : Results of this study will further elucidate the role of pharmacist led CGM in primary care .

Dietary extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) or vesicle like nanoparticles ( VLNs ) have been shown to exert beneficial functions in a wide range of diseases such as cancer , colitis , and metabolic diseases . They have also been used as natural carriers for medications . Despite the promising translational potential of dietary EVs or VLNs , the molecular mechanisms of their absorption in the gastrointestinal tract are not well understood . In this study , we investigated the absorption mechanisms of garlic chive derived VLNs ( GC VLNs ) using C57BL/6J mice and a human intestinal epithelial cell line , Caco 2 cells . We found that orally administered GC VLNs crossed the epithelial layer of the small intestine and entered the underlying lamina propria . GC VLNs were taken up and transported across the fully differentiated Caco 2 epithelial monolayer . Proteins and lipids , but not RNAs , in GC VLNs mediated their uptake by Caco 2 cells . Chemical inhibitor treatments demonstrated that macropinocytosis and fast endophilin mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) played key roles in the internalization of GC VLNs . On the other hand , clathrin coated pit mediated endocytosis and clathrin independent carrier/glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein enriched early endocytic compartment endocytosis did not contribute to GC VLN uptake . Activation of macropinocytosis and FEME using their specific activators promoted the internalization of GC VLNs . In addition , genetic manipulation of key molecules in macropinocytosis and FEME confirmed the important engagement of these two specific endocytic pathways in GC VLN absorption by human intestinal epithelial cells . Our study has provided proof of principle evidence to advance our understanding of the absorption mechanism of GC VLNs , which would be the key to further manipulation and engineering of these nanoparticles to improve their delivery efficiency as therapeutic modalities or drug carriers .

PURPOSE : The increasing prevalence of Plasmodium resistance to conventional artemisinin based combination therapies ( ACTs ) presents a significant threat to global malaria control . To address this , we developed a nanocarrier based co delivery system ( ND ARS/FLZ ) encapsulating artesunate ( ARS ) and fluconazole ( FLZ ) , aimed at enhancing therapeutic efficacy and overcoming drug resistance in a murine model of Plasmodium berghei infection . The rationale for combining ARS , an antimalarial , with FLZ , an antifungal , stems from recent studies indicating potential synergistic effects on Plasmodium metabolism and drug resistance mechanisms . METHODS : The ND ARS/FLZ nanocarrier was synthesized using a second generation dendrimer platform , and its structural characteristics were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) , dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) , and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . Encapsulation efficiency and drug loading were also determined . Antiplasmodial efficacy was assessed by quantifying parasitemia on day 4 post treatment in infected mice . Histopathological analysis of liver tissue was performed to evaluate safety and biocompatibility . Statistical significance was determined using SPSS . RESULTS : The ND ARS/FLZ nanocarrier exhibited a spherical morphology with a mean diameter of 137 nm and demonstrated sustained drug release , achieving 98% FLZ and 92% ARS release within 42 hours . At a dose of 400 mg/kg ( 80 mg ARS + 44 mg FLZ ) , ND ARS/FLZ achieved complete parasitemia clearance ( 100% ) , significantly outperforming monotherapies ( P < 01 ) . The estimated ED was 146 mg/kg , indicating potent antimalarial activity . No histopathological signs of hepatotoxicity were observed ( P > 05 ) , supporting the formulation ' s favorable safety profile . The PEGylated dendrimer core , combined with a citric acid functionalized surface , enhanced the antimalarial efficacy of encapsulated drugs while concurrently minimizing off target toxicity . CONCLUSION : The ND ARS/FLZ nanocarrier exhibits potent antimalarial activity and a promising safety profile , positioning it as a potential candidate for treating drug resistant malaria . The synergistic drug combination , coupled with nanocarrier mediated delivery , offers a novel approach to overcoming resistance . Future studies should further explore the pharmacokinetics , host parasite interactions , and mechanisms of action using techniques such as mass spectrometry , NMR , and in vivo imaging to facilitate preclinical advancement .
Preeclampsia ( PE ) , a severe pregnancy specific disorder , poses significant health risks to both mothers and fetuses . Certain dietary habits , such as tea consumption , may affect the activity of enzymes involved in hormone metabolism , leading to alterations in the levels of important pregnancy related hormone metabolites , such as 2 methoxyestradiol ( 2 MeO E ) , which may contribute to the development of PE . To investigate the effect of tea intake on pregnancy , we conducted both in vivo and in vitro experiments . Pregnant rats were administered tea polyphenols and epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) by gavage starting from pregnancy day We found that tea polyphenols and EGCG intake during pregnancy induced PE like symptoms in the rats such as hypertension , proteinuria and growth restriction of fetuses . These symptoms could be rescued by cotreatment of 2 MeO E ( ) Notably , the levels of the estrogen metabolite 2 MeO E in rat blood were significantly reduced , and the activity of the enzyme responsible for its metabolism , catechol O methyltransferase ( COMT ) , was also inhibited . Furthermore , EGCG impaired the migration ability of HTR8/SVneo cells , which could be alleviated by 2 MeO E supplementation . These findings indicate that tea polyphenols intake during pregnancy can cause PE like symptoms by inhibiting COMT activity and production of 2 MeO E .
Obesity during pregnancy is associated with increased risk for vitamin D deficiency in both the mother and offspring . Free or unbound 25 hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) is the biologically active form as compared to total 25 ( OH ) D , which may be important in the assessment of vitamin D status during conditions like pregnancy where vitamin D binding protein ( VDBP ) is affected . Little is known about how pre pregnancy BMI affects changes in vitamin D markers during pregnancy . This is a secondary analysis of data and biospecimens from the 2009 2014 National Children ' s Study ( NCS ) . The current analysis included 50 participants ( 50% normal weight [5 >/=BMI<25kg/m] and 50% overweight/obese [BMI>/=25kg/m] ) , recruited across four US Census regions ( Northeast , South , West , and Midwest ) , with serum samples available from three time points during pregnancy : 1 ( st ) half ( <25 weeks ) , 2 ( nd ) half ( >25 weeks ) a ( nd ) birth . Total 25 ( OH ) D was quantified via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC MS/MS ) , and commercially available assays were used to measure free 25 ( OH ) D and VDBP . Percent free 25 ( OH ) D was calculated as free25OHDtotal25OHDx Linear mixed effect models , including quadratic gestational age term were employed to exam the change in vitamin D metabolites by quadratic gestational age , as well as interactions with pre pregnancy BMI and season of birth . A positive linear trend was observed for total 25 ( OH ) D levels across gestation ( p=002 ) , while quadratic relationships were observed for both VDBP ( p<001 ) and % free 25 ( OH ) D ( p=001 ) . A significant interaction was observed between gestational age and season of birth for total 25 ( OH ) D ( p<001 ) and free 25 ( OH ) D ( p=006 ) . Furthermore , the interactive effect of gestational age and pre pregnancy BMI was statistically significant for both total 25 ( OH ) D ( p=002 ) and % free 25 ( OH ) D ( p=007 ) . Our results suggest that among a sample of US women both season of birth and maternal pre pregnancy BMI affected changes in vitamin D metabolites across pregnancy . The effects of maternal BMI on changes in total 25 ( OH ) D and % free 25 ( OH ) D across pregnancy suggest maternal obesity may differentially affect vitamin D metabolism in pregnancy . Future research is necessary to compare differences in vitamin D metabolism among obesity affected pregnancies as compared to healthy weight counterparts .
Postmenopausal conditions are linked to elevated risks of various complications , particularly cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs ) . While estrogen supplementation is a standard intervention , it increase adverse effects of CVDs and breast cancer prevalence in postmenopausal women . Spermidine , a naturally occurring polyamine , has recently emergeed attention for its protective effects in heart pathologies . However , the cardioprotective effects of spermidine against estrogen deprivation related cardiac dysfunctions remain unclear . We hypothesized that spermidine exerted cardiometabolic protection by mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction , mitochondrial dynamics alterations , oxidative stress , inflammation , and cardiac cell death in female rats with ovariectomy ( OVX ) induced estrogen deprivation . Fifty female Wistar rats were divided into a sham group ( n = 10 ) and a 12 week OVX operated group ( n = 40 ) . The OVX rats were randomly assigned to receive either vehicle treatment , spermidine ( OS , 20 mg/kg/day , p . o . , n = 10 ) , or estradiol ( OE , 50 mg/kg/day , s . c . , n = 10 ) for 8 weeks . Echocardiography and heart rate variability ( HRV ) were assessed , followed by euthanasia for cardiac tissue collection and blood sampling . OVX rats exhibited impaired metabolic , mitochondrial , and autophagic functions , along with elevated oxidative stress , inflammation , and apoptosis , leading to LV dysfunction . Spermidine and estrogen equally ameliorated all cardiometabolic adverse effects in OVX induced estrogen deprived female rats , suggesting spermidine as a promising alternative therapy for preventing cardiometabolic dysfunction in postmenopausal women .
AIMS : The AMD Annals initiative , active in Italy since 2006 , monitors diabetes care quality , showing continuous improvements through standardized indicators . This report presents the 2024 data on type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . METHODS : Approximately half of the Italian diabetes centers annually extract anonymized electronic medical records data . Process , treatment and outcome indicators , and the Q score , a validated score of overall care , were evaluated . RESULTS : Data from 301 centers on 680 , 122 T2D patients ( 6 % men , mean age 9 years ; 9 % > 75 years ) were evaluated . HbA1c </= 0 % was achieved by 9 % of patients , LDL < 70 mg/dl by 6 % , blood pressure ( BP ) < 130/80 mmHg by 5 % , with 7 % meeting multiple targets . Obesity showed a prevalence of 35 % , while smoking was high ( 9 % ) . Pharmacological treatment improved : 0 % used lipid lowering drugs , 8 % BP lowering , and 6 % glucose lowering drugs . As for innovative drugs , 9 % of patients were treated with SGLT2i and 5 % with GLP1 RA , with an increasing trend compared to 2023 data . Complication rates remained stable , with a further Q score improvement . CONCLUSIONS : The 2024 data confirm ongoing improvements in T2D care , despite an aging population . Although gaps persist , the path toward aligning practice with guidelines is well established .
Arrestin domain containing 3 ( ARRDC3 ) , a member of the alpha arrestins family , plays an important regulatory role in host anti tumor and cellular metabolism by modulating the degradation and transportation of G protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . However , the function of ARRDC3 in fish remains largely unexplored , particularly in host antiviral response . Here , we identified a paralog of ARRDC3 in teleost , zebrafish ARRDC3a , which was found to be induced by spring viremia of carp virus ( SVCV ) in vivo and in vitro . Overexpression of ARRDC3a significantly attenuated IFN expression and facilitated SVCV replication , whereas its knockdown inhibited viral proliferation . Furthermore , ARRDC3a overexpression markedly suppressed the IFN response triggered by retinoic acid inducible gene I ( RIG I ) like receptors ( RLRs ) signaling pathway , and reduced the protein stability of TBK1 , MITA , and IRF In summary , our findings suggest that zebrafish ARRDC3a acts as a negative regulator of type I IFN production by targeting RLR associated signaling molecules , thereby promoting SVCV replication in the host . Our study provides novel insights into the biological function of ARRDC3a in fish .
Metaflammation is characteristic of chronic metabolic inflammation , associated with increased risk of development of metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease ( MASLD ) . Palmitoylation of Myeloid differentiation factor 88 ( MyD88 ) adaptor protein mediates biologically important signal transduction pathways in inflammatory responses . However , the molecular mechanisms underlying MyD88 palmitoylation contributes to lipid induced metaflammation in the progression of MASLD is not completely understood . In this study , an increment of MyD88 palmitoylation was observed in the livers of high fat diet fed mice , accompanied by increased lipid accumulation and an inflammatory response . Inhibition of MyD88 palmitoylation attenuated the inflammation and hepatic steatosis in HFD induced mice . Mechanistically , palmitoylation of MyD88 activated NF kappaB p65 and p38 MAPK signals in a selenoprotein K ( SelK ) DHHC6 palmitoyltransferase complex dependent pathway . Intervention of SelK SH3 binding domain reduced the palmitoylation level of MyD88 by inhibiting the interaction between SelK and DHHC Our findings suggest that MyD88 palmitoylation regulates the metabolic disorder and metaflammation through SelK/DHHC6 dependent pathway , cooperatively . Inhibition of MyD88 palmitoylation and SelK SH3 binding domain may represent a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of MASLD progression .
Alternative splicing ( AS ) plays a crucial role in the post transcriptional regulation of gene expression , influencing skeletal muscle growth and development . However , research into transcriptomic landscape of AS and its key isoforms associated with skeletal muscle in goats is comparatively limited compared with other livestock species such as pigs . In this study , longissimus dorsi muscles from 4 Macheng black goats and 4 Boer goats were used to perform Oxford Nanopore Technologies full length sequencing and Illumina RNA seq . A total of 91 , 874 unique full length non chimeric sequences and 10 , 955 novel isoforms were identified . Subsequently , we detected 13 , 866 AS events and 1702 novel long non coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) , with exon skipping ( 4024 , 02 % ) being the most prevalent AS event . In addition , a total of 2267 differentially expressed isoforms ( DEIs ) were identified between Macheng black and Boer goats . Among these DEIs , 1301 isoforms were up regulated and 966 were down regulated in Macheng black goats . Functional enrichment analyses revealed that these DEIs were predominantly associated with pathways related to skeletal muscle development , cellular metabolic processes , and genetic information processing . Notably , we identified LUC7L 201 as an important isoform that negatively regulates cell proliferation and differentiation in goat primary myoblasts , as demonstrated by overexpression experiments . Overall , this study enhances our understanding of the transcriptomic diversity underlying skeletal muscle growth and development in goats , providing valuable insights for future research and potential applications in livestock management .
BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Dysregulation of naive BCR signaling and the generation of antibody secreting B cells ( ASCs ) have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases . Anergic B cells ( B ( ND ) s ) are naive B cells with a low density of surface IgM BCR , thus demonstrating attenuated autoantigen responsiveness . However , potential regulatory mechanisms of B cell anergy and their roles in autoimmune hepatitis ( AIH ) remain unestablished . METHODS : The frequency of circulating B cell subsets and comparative phenotypic analyses were conducted using flow cytometry . Primary human CD19 ( + ) B cells were differentiated in vitro with inosine or specific inhibitors , followed by qPCR , western blotting , and flow cytometry analyses . The effects of inosine were evaluated in a concanavalin A induced AIH mouse model , and a specific equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 ( ENT1 ) inhibitor was utilized both in vitro and in vivo . RESULTS : An elevated frequency of ASCs but a diminish of B ( ND ) s were observed in AIH . B ( ND ) s showed attenuated activated status compared to C ( NB ) s . B ( ND ) s uniquely exhibited high level expression of CD73 , the rate limiting enzyme in purinergic metabolism . Inosine , as the end product of the extracellular purinergic pathway , significantly enhanced B ( ND ) s expansion and inhibited ASCs differentiation in vitro . Mechanically , extracellular inosine was taken up via ENT1 , promoting surface IgM internalization by inhibiting the PARP14 STAT6 signaling pathway . Pharmacological inhibition of ENT1 with dipyridamole reversed therapeutic effects of inosine both in vitro and in vivo . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings revealed that inosine was a crucial metabolite that induced immune tolerance of B cells , thus proposing a potential intervention strategy for AIH .
We propose a mathematical model based on coupled ordinary differential equations ( ODEs ) for metabolite concentrations with the aim of investigating how modifications to the rates affects outputs from a regulatory network . Our aim is to model the relationships between energy metabolism and the biosynthesis of non essential amino acids , such as serine . We consider a network of cytosolic glycolysis , the mitochondrial TCA cycle , and the associated serine synthesis pathway , with the aim of modelling the role of metabolic reprogramming as a mechanism to enhance protein synthesis and growth , particularly in skeletal muscle . Our objective is to explore the consequences of overexpressing two key enzymes , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 ( PCK2 ) , and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase ( PHGDH ) , on the TCA cycle and on serine production . We investigate how the rate of serine synthesis is affected by upregulating both enzymes simultaneously , or each one individually . We find a range of steady states which depend upon input fluxes into the network . As input fluxes are altered , steady states cease to exist due to a bifurcation to one of two states in which some metabolites grow linearly in time whilst others decay to zero . Asymptotic analysis provides approximations for steady state solutions near these bifurcation points , and conditions on parameter values which determine where in parameter space the system ' s behaviour changes . We also perform a parameter sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of perturbations to rate constants and input rates . Our numerical simulations show that the up regulation of PHGDH , the initial rate limiting enzyme in the serine synthesis pathway , causes an increase in serine production but that , contrary to our hypothesis , increased expression of PCK2 has no effect . This model aids our understanding of both the effects of drugs and changes in enzyme expression or activities which upregulate one or more reactions in a pathway .
INTRODUCTION : Patients with metabolic syndrome and heart failure ( HF ) often have accompanying kidney dysfunction , which was recently defined as cardiovascular kidney metabolic ( CKM ) syndrome . Prior metabolomics profiling of metabolic syndrome patients identified a plasma branched chain amino acid ( BCAA ) signature , and BCAAs themselves are elevated in the myocardium of patients with HF , potentially due to a defect in BCAA catabolic breakdown . The rate limiting step of BCAA catabolism is the decarboxylation by the enzyme branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase ( BCKDH ) , which is negatively regulated by BCKDH kinase ( BCKDK or BDK ) , and BDK inhibitors improve metabolism and heart failure preclinically . METHODS : Here , using two pre clinical CKM models , the hyperphagic ZSF1 obese rat and the uninephrectomized SDT fatty rat with high salt drinking water , we show that BCAA catabolic impairment is associated with and may be causal to CKM . Unbiased proteomic , transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling demonstrated impairment in BCAA catabolism within ZSF1 obese rat kidneys . RESULTS : In both CKM animal models , treatment with the BDK inhibitor BT2 improved urine protein content , kidney hypertrophy , and kidney pathology . Furthermore , coadministration of BT2 and the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin demonstrated additive effects to improve kidney parameters , kidney gene expression signatures , and kidney mitochondrial density and function . CONCLUSIONS : Our study suggests that in addition to its previously reported effects on metabolism and cardiac function , BDK inhibition may also improve kidney health and therefore could represent a new therapeutic avenue for CKM .

It consolidates current research , emphasizing the potential of these hydrocolloids and related compounds in the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs ) .
The growth and lipid accumulation of skeletal muscle directly affects the yield and meat quality characteristics of beef , which is the result of the interaction between skeletal muscle cells ( SMCs ) and intramuscular adipocytes ( IMAs ) . Therefore , in this study , a co culture system was used to simulate the in vivo cellular microenvironment , aiming to reveal the interaction patterns between bovine SMCs and IMAs during the proliferation and differentiation stages . The results showed that , compared with SMCs cultured alone , the presence of IMAs in the co culture system inhibited the expression of proliferation markers such as PCNA , CDK1 , CDK2 , CCNA2 , and CCNE2 in SMCs . This also affected the G1/S phase transition of SMCs , thereby inhibiting their proliferation rate . Meanwhile , the presence of IMAs also inhibited the expression of myogenesis markers such as MYHC , MYOD , MYOG , MYF5 , and MYF6 , thus hindering the myotube formation process of SMCs . Moreover , RNA seq identified that the key genes APOE , APOD , SOX9 , CAV3 , SMPD3 and EDN2 that mediate the interaction between SMCs and IMAs in the co culture system . Among that , APOE has a dual effect on myogenesis and lipid accumulation . Interfering with the expression of APOE inhibited the proliferation , differentiation and lipid accumulation of SMCs . Based on these findings , we determined that APOE is a key regulatory factor connecting muscle development and fat accumulation . As a potential intervention target , APOE has great potential and can open up new avenues for improving meat quality and production efficiency .
N , N dimethylformamide ( DMF ) is a widely used polar aprotic solvent as well as a troublesome toxic pollutant , removal of which has attracted increasing attention . Certain organisms encode N , N dimethylformamidase ( DMFase ) to metabolize DMF . In the present work , molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics were adopted to explore the mechanism of DMF in DMFase . The calculations show that the structure that N atom of DMF coordinated with Fe ( 3+ ) is the preferred initial conformation ( N pathway ) , compared with the structure in which O atom coordinated with Fe ( 3+ ) ( O pathway ) . In the N pathway , the coordination of N and Fe ( 3+ ) disables the conjugation effect of the amide bond in the substrate and ligand field is highly flexible . By contrast , the conjugated structure of DMF is maintained well in the O pathway , and ligand field is highly rigid with conserved electronic states during the water attack step . These two factors lead to the higher energy barrier in the O pathway , while N pathway is the preferred mechanism for DMF degradation . In addition , we displayed that Glu657 is involved in the catalytic process as a proton transfer mediator . Our work sheds light on the metabolic mechanism of DMF in DMFase , revealing the important role of ligand field in the catalytic process .
OBJECTIVES : To describe and understand differences between U . S . rural and urban populations with respect to outcomes of hospitalization and related epidemiology of Non alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . METHODS : We analyzed data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project ( HCUP ) National Inpatient Sample ( NIS ) from 2007 to 2019 , identifying 847 , 165 NAFLD cases , of which 370 , 131 met inclusion criteria . Statistical analyses included Pearson ' s chi square , independent samples t tests , Mann Whitney U tests , and multivariate logistic regression models to examine factors associated with NAFLD . RESULTS : Hospitalizations due to NAFLD significantly increased over time from 2007 2019 with urban cases constituting 9% while rural cases represented 1% . Differences in demographics , hospital characteristics , insurance , income , and outcomes were significant between the two groups . Multivariate analysis showed higher odds of NAFLD diagnosis in fringe metro areas ( adjusted odds ratio [a . O . R . ]=074 , 95% CI=044 105 ) , medium metro counties ( ( a . O . R . =146 , 95% CI=114 179 ) , small metro counties ( a . O . R . =182 , 95% CI=140 226 ) , and rural regions ( a . O . R . =279 , 95% CI=233 327 ) compared to central metro areas . NAFLD was more prevalent in females , those aged 35 49 or 50 64 years , and White patients , particularly among those with diabetes , metabolic syndrome , and obesity . CONCLUSION : The increasing prevalence of NAFLD suggests a strong association with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases . With increasing closure of rural hospitals , we may see more rural patients with NAFLD admitted to urban centers . Early detection and diagnosis should help prevent long term complications of NAFLD .
Continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) has transformed the care of patients with diabetes , and there is great potential to extend these benefits to prediabetes . The recent FDA approval of over the counter CGMs has increased interest for use in individuals with prediabetes . It is of particular interest to use CGM to guide early individualized lifestyle interventions to prevent the progression of prediabetes to diabetes and support reversion to normoglycemia . In this review , we discuss published evidence regarding CGM metrics in normoglycemia , briefly review the use of CGM to diagnose prediabetes , and review available evidence for CGM use during lifestyle interventions in individuals with prediabetes . Future studies are needed to validate CGM metrics for prediabetes and evaluate effects of early intervention with CGM in this population .
Drug addiction is closely related to the dysregulation of complex neural circuits . However , the neural pathways underlying methamphetamine ( METH ) induced addiction remain unclear . Firstly , we performed ∆FosB ( Delta FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog B ) immunofluorescence and fiber optic recording experiments to assess the neural activity of glutamatergic neurons in the anterior insular cortex ( IC ) in METH treated mice . Then , we evaluated the effect of activation or inhibition of glutaminergic neurons in IC on METH induced conditioned place preference ( CPP ) behavior through chemogenetic manipulation . Finally , we used adeno associated virus ( AAV ) mediated neural tracing to verify the projections connectivity from IC to the basolateral amygdala ( BLA ) and investigated their blocking role in METH mediated CPP behavior using chemogenetic and neural ablation strategies . We found that glutamatergic neurons in the IC were activated by METH . Activation of these neurons enhanced METH mediated CPP behavior , whereas inhibition of their activity attenuated the CPP expression . Furthermore , we observed robust projections from IC neurons to the BLA . Activation of IC neurons projecting to the BLA enhanced METH mediated CPP behavior , whereas ablation of BLA neurons receiving projections from IC significantly impaired METH mediated CPP performance . These results highlight the IC glutaminergic neurons are a major target of METH addiction , with the IC BLA glutaminergic neural projection playing an important role in regulating METH mediated CPP behavior . This pathway may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of METH addiction and serve as a potential target for therapeutic strategies .
Sleep plays a crucial role in restoring and repairing the body , consolidating memory , regulating emotions , maintaining metabolic and so on . Sleep deprivation is known to impair cognitive functions . In this study , we investigated the mechanisms underlying memory impairment induced by sleep deprivation through a combined metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis of hippocampus . Eight week old mice were selected as the study subjects and the sleep deprivation chamber was used to establish a sleep deprivation ( SD ) model . Novel object recognition tests ( NOR ) , and Y maze tests were used to assess the behavioral outcomes in mice . The hippocampus were extracted and studied using the untargeted metabolomics or transcriptomics high throughput sequencing method . An integrative analysis was conducted to elucidate the metabolic and genetic changes . Behavioral tests showed that SD group exhibited memory impairment . Metabolomic analysis identified 84 differentially expressed metabolites ( DEMs ) , including 12 under the positive ion mode and 72 under the negative ion mode . The analysis revealed that sleep deprivation caused abnormalities in several metabolic pathways , with particularly pronounced effects observed in glycerophospholipid metabolism , linoieic acid metabolism , alanine , aspartate , glutamate metabolism , taurine and hypotaurine metabolism , and purine metabolism . While transcriptomic analysis releaved 97 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) ( 51 were down regulated and 46 were up regulated DEGs ) . Integrative analysis of the metabolomic and transcriptomic identified profiles showed that sleep deprivation may regulate taurine and hypotaurine metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism , there by influencing memory . Our results prompt severe metabolic disturbances occur in the hippocampus with SD in mice , which can provide a basis for the mechanism research .
Protein prenylation has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions , including cytoskeletal remodeling , trafficking and fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane . It involves incorporation of either a 15 carbon farnesyl or a 20 carbon geranylgeranyl derivative of mevalonic acid into cysteines at the C terminus of substrate proteins . At least four types of prenyltransferases , namely farnesyl transferase ( FTase ) and the geranylgeranyl transferases I III ( GGTase I , II , and III ) have been identified in mammalian cells . Published evidence suggests expression of functionally active forms of these prenyltransferases and their candidate substrate proteins in human islets , rodent islets , and clonal beta cells . Pharmacological and molecular biological evidence implicates requisite roles for protein prenylation in glucose stimulated insulin secretion . Evidence is also emerging to indicate significant defects in protein prenylome in beta cell models of impaired insulin secretion and diabetes . This review will provide a status update on modulatory roles of protein prenylation , enzymes involved in this signaling pathway , their structural composition and regulation in the context of islet beta cell function in normal health . In addition , experimental evidence on the metabolic fate of protein prenylation pathway in the pancreatic beta cell following chronic exposure to diabetogenic stimuli is reviewed herein . Lastly , crucial gaps in our current understanding , and potential opportunities for future research in this area of islet biology are highlighted .
BACKGROUND : Hyperkalemia is a critical electrolyte imbalance that can lead to life threatening arrhythmia and cardiac injury . The potential protective role of metformin on acute hyperkalemia remains unclear . Our study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of metformin against hyperkalemia induced arrhythmia and cardiac injury . METHODS : We induced hyperkalemia induced arrhythmia model in vivo using intragastric KCl overload in mice , and followed by low or high dose metformin or insulin to evaluate cardiac electrocardiography ( ECG ) , cardiac injury , and the regulation of key potassium channels . Additionally , we cultured HL 1 cells with different potassium concentration , and followed by insulin or metformin to assess the cell viability , apoptosis , regulation of key potassium channels and intracellular and extracellular calcium ( Ca ( 2+ ) ) dynamics . KEY FINDINGS : Our study demonstrates that both metformin and insulin have protective effects against hyperkalemia induced arrhythmia . Notably , metformin significantly reversed the expression of Kv2 and SK2 channels , which are critical for maintaining normal cardiac electrical activity . Furthermore , metformin improved cardiomyocyte viability and reduced apoptosis in hyperkalemic conditions . Our findings also reveal that metformin increased serum Ca ( 2+ ) levels and reduced intracellular Ca ( 2+ ) levels , which is associated with the upregulation of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . These results suggest that metformin exerts its protective effects through distinct mechanisms compared to insulin . SIGNIFICANCE : These findings have important implications for the management of hyperkalemia , particularly in patients with underlying insulin resistance or those who cannot tolerate insulin therapy . By demonstrating the protective effects of metformin , our study opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention and further research into the role of metformin in cardiac protection .
The mitochondrial enzyme , glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( GOT2 ) , catalyzes the reaction between oxaloacetate and glutamate generating aspartate and alpha ketoglutarate ( alpha KG ) . Glutamate can also be directly converted to alpha KG by glutamate dehydrogenase . We investigated mitochondrial and systemic effects of an inducible liver specific mouse GOT2 knockout ( KO ) . We observed no differences in body mass or percent fat mass in KO mice , however , KO mice had lower fasting glucose and liver tissue contained more fat . Respiration by liver mitochondria energized at complex II by succinate + glutamate was decreased in KO compared to wildtype ( WT ) mice at low inner membrane potential ( DeltaPsi ) as induced by titration with ADP . Metabolite studies by NMR showed that at low versus high DeltaPsi , GOT2KO mitochondria energized by succinate + glutamate generated more oxaloacetate ( a potent inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase , SDH ) and less aspartate . Respiration and mitochondrial metabolites energized by pyruvate + malate or palmitoyl carnitine + malate did not differ between KO and WT mice . Respiration by GOT2KO mitochondria energized by glutamate + malate was decreased at all levels of DeltaPsi . Pathway analysis of LC MS profile data in liver tissue of KO versus WT mice revealed differential enrichment of the malate aspartate shuttle , TCA cycle , aspartate metabolism , glutamate metabolism , and gluconeogenesis . In summary , GOT2KO impaired potential dependent complex II energized O flux likely due at least in part to oxaloacetate inhibition of SDH .
Biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass offers a transformative solution to reduce global fossil fuel dependency . Certain thermophilic anaerobes , including Clostridium thermocellum , show promise for renewable ethanol production due to their ability to break down plant material at high temperatures . However , achieving commercially viable ethanol yields has proven challenging despite extensive engineering efforts . Here , we characterized 27 ferredoxin : NADP ( + ) oxidoreductase ( Fnor ) enzymes for their enzyme activity , nicotinamide cofactor specificity , thermotolerance , and functional expression in C . thermocellum . We identified a subset of ten of these enzymes as a novel class of Fnor enzymes suited for metabolic pathways aimed at high titer ethanol production . When expressed in engineered C . thermocellum , these enzymes increased ethanol production up to 2 fold . These findings establish a novel ethanol pathway and provide insights into physiological roles and biotechnological applications of this new class of Fnor enzymes .
Obesity is a significant health concern , significantly contributing to increased morbidity and mortality by disrupting multiple physiological systems . It is strongly associated with metabolic dysfunctions , including impaired glycemic homeostasis , compromised intestinal barrier integrity , and gut microbiota imbalances , all exacerbating the risk of chronic diseases . The hydroalcoholic extract of acai seeds ( ASE ) , rich in phenolic compounds , has demonstrated beneficial effects on obesity and hyperglycemia ; however , its impacts on gut health and gut hypothalamus communication remain unclear . This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of ASE in intestinal and hypothalamic alterations associated with obesity and compare it with Metformin . Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a high fat or standard diet for 14 weeks . The ASE ( 300mg/Kg/day ) and Metformin ( 300mg/Kg/day ) treatments started in the tenth week until the fourteenth week , totaling four weeks of treatment . Our data show that the treatment with ASE and Metformin reduced body weight , ameliorated lipid profile , hyperglycemia , and plasma hyperleptinemia , and decreased the oxidative damage in the gut by reducing immunostaining of 8 isoprostane and NOX 4 expression , and improved the intestinal parameters and hypothalamic gene expression . Obesity induced dysbiosis in the HF group was marked by reduced Proteobacteria and elevated LPS plasma levels , which were improved by treatments with ASE and Metformin . These findings suggest that ASE and Metformin are promising strategies to counteract the adverse effects of obesity on intestinal health and gut hypothalamus communication , though they act through distinct mechanisms . Therefore , we can suggest that ASE is a promising natural product for treating the intestinal alterations associated with obesity .
Dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , a precursor of sex hormones , has been implicated in the pathogenesis of non alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) or metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis ( MASH ) , with studies suggesting a strong correlation between DHEA levels and disease severity . In this study , we demonstrated that DHEA alleviated lipotoxicity induced hepatic damage by promoting autophagy . Our findings demonstrate that DHEA induced autophagy is mediated by estrogen receptor alpha ( ER alpha ) and androgen receptor ( AR ) activation and protects hepatic cells against palmitate induced apoptosis , steatosis , and inflammasome activation . DHEA treatment in a murine NASH model induced significant autophagy in the liver , further supporting the hepatoprotective role of DHEA . Collectively , our results identified DHEA as a pro autophagic hormone with therapeutic potential for the treatment of lipotoxicity in NASH .
Interactions between the liver and pancreas are key features of the carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis in healthy and pathological patients . To investigate the crosstalk between the two organs , we have developed an organ on chip coculture model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells . The presence of pancreatic derived tissue in the culture environment contributed to increase the CYP3A4 activity , the glycogen storage , and the expression of genes related to lipids , bile acids and sterol metabolism in the liver derived tissue . Concomitantly , the presence of liver cells led to increase the C peptide secretion in pancreas . The coculture with liver modulated the pancreatic differentiation by increasing the activity of important transcription factors ( REST , MAFB , PBX1 ) and by downregulating several hormone encoding genes ( INS , GCG , TTR ) . The liver also stimulated the expression of genes involved in the response to inflammation in pancreas ( via TGFbeta/SMAD pathway ) . In parallel we observed a pancreatic cell reorganization coupled with the activation of the cell proliferation related transcription factor ( SCRT1 ) and the upregulation of cellular remodeling genes ( FLNA , FLNB , FN1 , COL4A5 ) . Finally , the pancreatic lipid genes were also upregulated in presence of the liver tissue . Overall , our results reflect a complex synergy between both tissues . We believe that those results are an encouraging step toward the development of relevant human model using advanced organ on chip technology and stem cells sources .
Gut microbes play an immense role in digesting ingested food , providing nutrients to the host , and producing several bioactive metabolites that not only help maintain health but can also elicit disease during dysbiotic conditions . The bioactive compounds derived from gut microbiota metabolites include trimethylamine N oxide ( TMAO ) , uremic toxins , short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) , phytoestrogens , anthocyanins , bile acids , lipopolysaccharide to name a few . Once these compounds enter the host cells , tissues , and organs they can cause diseases such as epigenetic , metabolic , neurodegenerative , psychiatric , cardiovascular , hypertension , respiratory , gastrointestinal , kidney , bone , cancer , and others . Regulating healthy gut microbiota thus provides a potential option for the prevention , reversal , or even treatment of these diseases . Towards this end , various interventional strategies are postulated in this field of emerged and rapidly expanding health research arena that includes fecal microbiota transplantation , prebiotics , and probiotics , and to introduce the concept that correcting gut dysbiosis can ameliorate disease symptoms , thus offering a new approach towards dysbiosis related disease mitigation and treatment . In the special issue of Pharmacological Research titled " Gut Microbiota and Well Being , " several outstanding research findings and review articles are published , covering a broad spectrum of topics related to the influence of gut microbiota on health and disease . This editorial summarizes each of these contributions , prioritizing research findings before discussing the review articles . The summaries are restructured abstracts of relevant articles focusing on major findings or thematic topics .
The aging of population coupled with unhealthy dietary habits among residents has led to a rise in the incidence of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases ( CVMDs ) . Extensive research has highlighted the role of gut microbiota derived metabolites in CVMDs . Among these metabolites , phenylacetylglutamine ( PAGln ) , a meta organismal prothrombotic metabolite , has been proved to promote the progression of CVMDs . This bacterial derived metabolite is a byproduct of amino acid comes from phenylalanine ( Phe ) in the diet . There are increasing evidence showing that the level of PAGln is associated with the risk of developing CVMDs . To provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of PAGln in CVMDs , this review delves into the production and metabolic pathways of PAGln and discusses the links of PAGln and the pathogenesis of CVMDs .
Intratumoral microbiota are increasingly recognized for their impact on gastric cancer , with growing evidence highlighting their complexity and significance . This review synthesizes current knowledge on the origins , heterogeneity , detection , and mechanistic roles of intratumoral microbiota in gastric carcinogenesis . In gastric cancer , intratumoral microbiota can originate from mucosal disruption and may migrate from normal adjacent tissues or be influenced by the TME . It exhibits spatial and functional heterogeneity within gastric cancer . Despite challenges in the detection of intratumoral microbiota , advances in deep sequencing and spatial omics have enhanced our understanding of microbial diversity and functionality . Mechanistically , intratumoral microbiota influence gastric cancer development through genetic and epigenetic alterations , signaling pathway modulation , metabolic reprogramming , and regulation of chronic inflammation and immune responses . These insights underscore the microbiota ' s dual function in both promoting and hindering tumor advancement . Therapeutically , the microbiota ' s impact on chemotherapy resistance and immune modulation presents opportunities for novel interventions . Integrating microbiome analysis into cancer research and leveraging microbial therapies may enable more effective , personalized treatment strategies . Future research should further elucidate the intricate microbe tumor interactions to advance clinical applications and improve outcomes for gastric cancer patients .
This study aimed to delineate the protective role of fish oil against alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) , identify the principal active component between eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA , C20 : 5 n 3 ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA , C22 : 6 n 3 ) , and elucidate the molecular mechanisms . C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to receive either an alcohol fed ( AF ) or pair fed control ( PF ) diet , enriched with fish oil ( FO ) or corn oil ( CO ) for four weeks . Additionally , a series of in vitro experiments were performed using AML 12 cells to further investigate potential mechanisms . The results showed that plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) were significantly lower in the AF FO group compared to the AF CO group , indicating that fish oil alleviated alcohol induced liver damage . Hepatic antioxidant markers , including glutathione ( GSH ) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , and catalase ( CAT ) were also higher in the AF FO group than in the AF CO group . Transcriptomic analysis revealed FO supplementation significantly affected genes involved in oxidoreductase activity and lipid metabolism pathways , with Retsat being the most up regulated gene . The in vitro experiments indicated that DHA , but not EPA , markedly increased Retsat expression , cell viability , and the expression of genes related to oxidoreductase activity and lipid metabolism , compared to linoleic acid ( LA , C18 : 2 n 6 ) . Notably , knocking down Retsat abolished the protective effects of DHA . In conclusion , dietary fish oil mitigated chronic alcohol induced liver injury primarily through DHA by upregulating Retsat and downstream genes associated with oxidoreductase function and lipid metabolism .
The study was designed to explore the impact of fish oil supplement on the brain lipids profile in ApoE deficient ( ApoE / ) mice and wild type C57BL/6J ( C57 wt ) mice treated with diets containing varying dosage of vitamin E ( VE ) . Compared to C57 wt mice , ApoE / mice exhibited increased cortical TC and LDL C levels , but decreased HDL C level ( P < 05 ) . The fish oil intervention , combined with low dietary VE intake resulted in increased cortical protein expression of CD36 and PPARgamma in C57 wt mice . PI ( 36 : 5 ) was identified as a significantly different metabolite when compared to the control group in both C57 wt and ApoE / mice . The combination of fish oil and varying doses of VE had different effects on the expression of brain lipids and fatty acid transporters in ApoE / and C57 wt mice , indicating that ApoE status and dietary VE intake influence the responses of the cerebral lipids profile to fish oil supplementation .
The circadian clock enables organisms to predict daily environmental changes and synchronize their physiology and behaviour accordingly . Macrophages , key sensor cells in the innate immune system , exhibit cell autonomous circadian rhythmicity . This circadian rhythmic behaviour is synchronised to the central clock in the hypothalamus as a result of neural , and hormonal signals . Macrophage rhythms and responses involve sensing temporal cues , integrating information from tissue specific environments , and initiating context appropriate , time gated responses . On a broader scale , monocytes and macrophages communicate and synchronize with other immune cells , migrate throughout the body , and infiltrate tissues , collectively contributing to circadian regulation in both health and disease . While the field of macrophage circadian biology is rapidly advancing , it is equally important to reflect on its historical development , which has been shaped by over two centuries of accumulating knowledge and technological progress . This review traces key milestones in macrophage and circadian research , examining how recent discoveries have refined our understanding of early foundational questions and setting the stage for future inquiries . Notably , many intriguing questions remain unresolved , including the circadian regulation of macrophage function under steady state conditions , the tissue specific heterogeneity of macrophage circadian rhythms , and the role of macrophage circadian clocks in disease pathogenesis and their potential clinical implications .
INTRODUCTION : Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD ) is a chronic progressive vascular condition with high morbidity and mortality , often necessitating comprehensive management to mitigate cardiovascular risk . AIMS : This study assessed the feasibility of recruiting patients with PAD for a multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) based care intervention , comparing its effectiveness to standard care within a clinical trial setting . METHODS : Conducted as a cross sectional analysis nested within the ongoing TEAM PAD trial , this study targeted the recruitment of 30 patients within 12 weeks and evaluated recruitment , consent , and retention rates to assess feasibility . RESULTS : A total of 30 participants were consented within 11 weeks , with an overall recruitment rate of 4% and retention rate of 90% . Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups . Participants had a mean age of 9 years and a high prevalence of comorbidities . The mean 10 year cardiovascular risk ( SMART REACH ) was 8% . In the intervention group , implementing MDT recommendations is projected to reduce this risk by 1% . CONCLUSION : Recruitment of patients with PAD into an MDT intervention was feasible and timely , with strong retention and well balanced baseline characteristics . While modelled estimates suggest a potential benefit from MDT recommendations , these findings are preliminary and based on a small interim cohort . Evaluation of clinical effectiveness within the larger ongoing randomised controlled trial is needed to evaluate the medium and long term impacts of integrated vascular care .
WRKY transcription factors ( TFs ) are key regulators of plant tissue morphogenesis , defense responses , and metabolic regulation . However , the functions for most of WRKY TFs in 84K poplar ( Populus alba x P . glandulosa ) in regulating leaf morphology and responding to salt stress are remain unclear . In this study , overexpressing PagWRKY11 poplars were generated . Phenotypic analysis revealed that transgenic poplar leaves were narrower and smoother compared to the traditionally elliptical and relatively rough leaves of wild type ( WT ) plants . Then , the apical buds of transgenic poplars were sharp and elongated , with young leaves pointing upwards and inwards , whereas WT buds were rounder with smoother young leaves pointing downwards . Functional analysis indicated that under salt stress , the activities of SOD and POD enzymes and the expression of their encoding genes were significantly lower in transgenic poplars compared to WT . Conversely , the accumulation of HO and MDA was significantly higher . These results suggest that overexpression lines of PagWRKY11 increase salt sensitivity by downregulating the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes . Meanwhile , overexpression of PagWRKY11 increased the natural water loss rate of poplar leaves , and negatively regulated salt stress by affecting water retention . In addition , yeast one hybrid assays showed that PagWRKY11 binds specifically to W box elements . These results provide a theoretical basis for further exploration of the molecular mechanisms by which PagWRKY11 regulates leaf morphogenesis and stress responses , and offer new potential strategies for resistance breeding .
Pistacia lentiscus L . , a Mediterranean evergreen shrub , is well adapted to drought and valued for its nutraceutical properties . This study investigated how water stress affects the flavonoid and terpene composition of its fruits at two ripening stages : red ( R1 ) and dark purple/black ( R2 ) fruits . Female P . lentiscus plants were subjected to well watered ( WW ) and water stressed ( WS ) conditions . WW plants were irrigated to pot capacity , while WS plants received 70% of the water lost through evapotranspiration . Physiological measurements such as stomatal conductance ( g ( sw ) ) , maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II ( F ( v ) /F ( m ) ) , relative water content ( RWC ) , leaf water potential ( Psi ( w ) ) and chlorophyll index ( Chl ( i ) ) were assessed . Total Terpenes Content ( TTC ) was analyzed in fruit oil by GC MS , while Total Anthocyanins ( TAC ) and Flavonol Contents ( TFC ) were quantified in residual pellets with HPLC DAD . Results showed that g ( sw ) and Psi ( w ) declined in WS plants at both ripening stages , while RWC , F ( v ) /F ( m ) , and Chl ( i ) were unaffected , highlighting the species ' water conservative strategy which limited carbon availability for secondary metabolism . Consequently , water stress reduced TTC , TAC , and TFC at both stages . Despite this decline , stage specific adjustments in flavonoid biosynthesis were observed , with R1 fruits favoring tri hydroxylated flavonoids and R2 prioritizing di hydroxylated forms . Additionally , beta myrcene increased in WS fruits at R These changes suggest an adaptive antioxidant defense mechanism combined with a resource conservation strategy . These findings demonstrate that water stress modulates secondary metabolite pathways in P . lentiscus fruits , influencing their nutraceutical profile . Targeted irrigation strategies could optimize these metabolic responses , enhancing the fruit antioxidant and therapeutic potential .
BACKGROUND : Lifestyle factors have been widely associated with various major chronic diseases ( MCDs ) and life expectancy . OBJECTIVES : Our study aimed to investigate the relationship of healthy lifestyle with the odds of healthy aging and the mediating role of plasma proteins . METHODS : We included 26 , 774 participants from UK Biobank aged 64 years or older who were free of 15 MCDs at baseline . Healthy aging was defined as survival to age 80 without developing MCDs at the end of follow up . According to a composite score of seven lifestyle factors , the participants were grouped as having healthy ( 6 or 7 healthy lifestyle factors ) , intermediate ( 3 5 healthy lifestyle factors ) , or unhealthy ( 0 2 healthy lifestyle factors ) lifestyles . Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of lifestyle categories with the odds of healthy aging . In a subsample ( n = 3231 ) , proteomic signatures of healthy lifestyle were identified and their potential mediation on the relationship of healthy lifestyle with healthy aging were assessed . RESULTS : A total of 16 , 269 participants achieved healthy aging . Compared to an unhealthy lifestyle , a healthy lifestyle was associated with 117% ( 95% CI : 95% 141% ) higher odds of healthy aging , as well as lower risks of all cause mortality and various MCDs . There were 879 plasma proteins associated with healthy lifestyle , largely involving the pathways associated with immune inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis . There were 26 proteins which had the strongest correlations with healthy lifestyle ( absolute value of effect size >15 ) , among which 13 proteins were found to significantly explain 9% to 7% of the relationship between healthy lifestyle and healthy aging . Fatty acid binding protein 4 , adrenomedullin , and hepatocyte growth factor were the leading mediators . CONCLUSIONS : A healthy lifestyle is associated with substantially higher odds of healthy aging , potentially through the regulation of specific circulating proteins .
While the tumor suppressive functions of p53 are well established , the role of its homolog , TAp73 , in cancer remains incompletely characterized and is a subject of active investigation . In this study , we observed downregulation of TAp73 protein expression in cervical cancer tissues , which significantly correlated with adverse clinical outcomes . Through co expression network analysis , we identified functional associations between TAp73 and key pathways involved in lipid metabolism and redox homeostasis both critical regulators of ferroptosis , an iron dependent form of programmed cell death mediated by lipid peroxidation . Mechanistically , we demonstrate that TAp73 promotes ferroptosis by directly upregulating the transcription of beta transducin repeat containing protein ( beta TRCP ) , thereby facilitating the ubiquitin dependent degradation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 ( NRF2 ) , a master regulator of cellular antioxidant defenses . This TAp73 mediated suppression of NRF2 activity renders cells more susceptible to ferroptotic death . Furthermore , TAp73 expression is transcriptionally induced during ferroptosis through the combined inactivation of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 ( EZH2 ) , a core component of polycomb repressive complex 2 , and activation of E2F transcription factor 1 ( E2F1 ) . Notably , pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 synergized with sulfasalazine ( SAS ) to enhance ferroptosis in vivo , an effect largely dependent on TAp Together , these findings delineate a novel ferroptosis regulatory axis EZH2/TAp73/beta TRCP/NRF2 and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for cervical cancer intervention .
Although a protective shell based on a metal organic framework ( MOF ) can effectively improve the remediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) by microorganisms , the functional characteristics of the shell are often limited by the surface charge , chemical properties and intrinsic strain characteristics . This study explored the potential of mixed organic acids ( MA ) as an eco friendly modifier for zeolite imidazolate framework 8 ( ZIF 8 ) , facilitating the formation of a biomimetic mineralized shell around Bacillus subtilis ZL09 The addition of MA into the ZIF 8 protective shell was found to stimulate growth and bolster cell viability . Notably , adding MA contribute resulted in a 98 fold enhancement of the PHE degradation efficiency . After five cycles of reuse , ZIF 8 MA@B . subtilis ZL09 26 still maintained almost 90% of the initial PHE degradation ability .

With the world population continuously increasing , the protein demand will double by Single cell protein ( SCP ) derived from lignocellulosic biomass offers a sustainable solution . Many inhibitors are produced during the pretreatment process of lignocellulosic biomass . Inhibitor rich hydrolysates limit microorganisms cell growth and SCP yields . In this work , we report a co culture consortium of Kodamaea ohmeri SSK ( pentose utilizing yeast ) and Lactococcus lactis LX ( probiotic bacterium ) that efficiently converts real corn straw hydrolysate into SCP . K . ohmeri SSK can tolerate inhibitors such as furfural , 5 hydroxymethylfurfural ( 5 HMF ) , and acetic acid and consume glucose , xylose , and arabinose in real hydrolysate . L . lactis LX showed less growth in monoculture than that of co culture . The total amino acid content from co cultured K . ohmeri SSK and L . lactis LX was increased to 42 mg/g crude protein , but that of monocultured K . ohmeri SSK was 89 mg/g crude protein containing 17 amino acids . This work demonstrates a symbiotic microbial platform can produce SCP from non detoxified lignocellulosic biomass . The co culture robust inhibitor tolerance and balanced amino acid profile highlight its potential for industrial scale protein production . These results will represent an attractive choice cell factory for lignocellulosic substrate utilization and provide a platform for biomass conversion to SCP .
Hypophosphatasia ( HPP ) is the inborn error of metabolism from deactivating mutation ( s ) of ALPL , the gene that encodes the cell surface " tissue nonspecific " isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase ( TNSALP ) . HPP ' s " biochemical signature " comprises low serum alkaline phosphatase activity together with elevated plasma levels of the TNSALP natural substrates phosphoethanolamine ( PEA ) , pyridoxal 5 ' phosphate ( PLP ) , and inorganic pyrophosphate ( PPi ) . Excess extracellular PPi ( ePPi ) inhibits mineralization and affected children prematurely shed deciduous teeth and often suffer weakness and rickets . Yet , HPP severity is greatest among all dento osseous disorders and not fully explained by autosomal dominant versus autosomal recessive inheritance involving >470 ALPL mutations . Discordance of HPP phenotype sometimes manifests even among full siblings sharing an identical ALPL genotype . Herein , a girl ' s markedly discordant HPP featured at presentation life threatening hypercalcemia , failure to thrive , and renal compromise . Subsequent pseudotumor cerebri syndrome caused blindness , and then craniosynostosis required cranial vault reconstruction . However , she was not deformed , had moderate hypophosphatasemia , normal plasma PLP level , and mild radiographic features of HPP rickets . Elevated plasma N terminal parathyroid hormone related protein ( PTHrP ) suggested malignancy , but corrected after kidney transplantation . HPP was diagnosed when whole exome sequencing revealed heterozygous ALPL c . 1034C>T , p . A345V reported in mild pediatric HPP and transmitted by her mother who considered herself well . Genes conditioning ePPi formation and underlying other skeletal diseases were intact . Hypercalcemia , unresponsive to bone antiresorptive drugs , corrected promptly with asfotase alfa TNSALP supplementation therapy . Her markedly discordant findings highlight genotype/phenotype plasticity for pediatric HPP , and her clinical course importance for early diagnosis .
Fexaramine , a gut restricted farnesoid X receptor ( FXR ) agonist , promotes glucose and lipid homeostasis , improves insulin sensitivity , promotes white adipose tissue browning , and stimulates nonshivering thermogenesis . Enhancement in energy expenditure due to an increase in amount of energy burned by brown and ' beige ' adipocytes results in subsequent weight loss . Fexaramine is poorly absorbed into circulation when delivered orally , which limits systemic FXR activation and toxicity . An increase in beta3 adrenoceptor signaling , activation of Takeda G protein coupled receptor 5/glucagon like peptide 1 ( TGR5/GLP 1 ) signaling , and induction of fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) 19/FGF 15 play crucial roles in fexaramine metabolic actions . Intestinal FXR activation is a promising , potentially safe approach for treating obesity and metabolic syndrome .
The free fatty acid receptor 1 ( FFAR1 ) is a transmembrane G protein coupled receptor that mediates the metabolic and insulinotropic effects of endogenous free fatty acids in pancreatic cells while also exerting neuro regulatory effects in the brain . The complexity of FFAR1 derives from its multiple binding sites and the absence of conventional activation motifs observed in class A GPCRs . This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular mechanisms that underpin endogenous signaling and allosteric regulation in the FFAR We investigated and compared three ligand bound states and the APO state . The ligand bound simulations included FFAR1 in complex with gamma linolenic acid , FFAR1 in complex with gamma linolenic acid and TAK875 , and a fully activated FFAR1 bundle complexed with docosahexaenoic acid and G protein . The results highlight distinct protein contact fingerprints and dynamics in the ligand bound states relative to the APO state . While ligand binding , in the absence of stabilizing G protein , destabilizes the intracellular domain of the receptor , the second extracellular loop exhibits greater stability and salt bridge contact with the transmembrane domain . Notably , simulations of FFAR1 complexed with gamma linolenic acid , bound at the intracellular domain , revealed stable interactions between gamma linolenic acid and the receptor , as well as similar activation fingerprints when compared to FFAR1 in complex with docosahexaenoic acid and Gq . This suggests an effective allosteric regulation of the receptor following gamma linolenic acid binding to the intracellular domain . Finally , a set of hydrophobic amino acid residues at the intracellular and extracellular domains appears to function as potential rotameric switches , facilitating water mediated receptor activation .
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Radiotherapy is one of the standard treatments for breast cancer , but causes adverse effects in normal tissues , narrowing the therapeutic window . Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester ( CAPE ) has been proposed to have cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effects in cancer cells , whilst protective properties in normal tissues . We have investigated the anti tumour effects of CAPE in breast cancer in vitro and in vivo and provided evidence regarding its radioprotective effect . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effects were determined in vitro in luminal A , HER2 + and triple negative breast cancer and in normal breast cell lines by cell viability and clonogenic survival assays , respectively . Effects on cell metabolism , mitochondrial function and inflammation were investigated . CAPE anti tumour effects were also investigated in vivo in a MDA MB 231 tumour bearing mouse model . RESULTS : Cell viability decreased upon CAPE treatment in a dose dependent manner ( IC 5 +/ 7 microM ) . CAPE shifted cellular metabolism towards glycolysis ( p < 05 ) and induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization ( p < 01 ) . CAPE sensitized only p53 mutated or deficient cell lines to radiotherapy ( p < 05 ) , but not p53 proficient lines . In normal breast cells , CAPE increased the surviving fraction upon radiation ( p = 03 ) . NF kappaB activity was decreased in p53 mutant cancer cells ( p < 01 ) , but increased in p53 proficient lines ( p < 01 ) upon CAPE treatment . Combination of radiotherapy and CAPE resulted in increased survival ( 22 days ) compared to control ( p < 05 ) . CONCLUSION : Our findings highlight that CAPE could widen the therapeutic window in breast cancer with non functional p53 , by radiosensitizing the tumour cells while protecting the normal tissue .
Glaucomatous optic neuropathy represents a prevalent optic nerve degenerative disease . Neuroinflammation is recognized as a significant mechanism underlying optic nerve damage in glaucoma ; however , the precise mechanisms driving neuroinflammation remain largely elusive . Existing studies have indicated that microglia driven neuroinflammation is pivotal for neuroinflammation onset and progression . Mitochondrial dysfunction , encompassing mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) damage , metabolic deficiencies , and quality control impairments , is upstream of microglial activation and neuroinflammation . Thus , a deeper comprehension of the link between mitochondrial dysfunction and microglial activation in glaucoma may provide valuable insights into the underlying pathogenesis . As a result of these findings , promising avenues for developing effective interventions to mitigate optic nerve damage and preserve visual function in glaucoma patients have been identified .
Research indicates that abnormal gut microbiota metabolism is linked to colorectal cancer ( CRC ) progression , but the role of microbiota related tryptophan metabolism disruption remains unclear . Using metagenomic sequencing and targeted Trp metabolomics , our research identified that CRC patients had abnormal indole 3 lactic acid ( ILA ) levels , which were related to tumor malignancy . Exogenous ILA administration suppressed CRC development in AOM/DSS induced and xenograft mice models . Furthermore , in vitro experiments demonstrated that ILA inhibits tumor cell proliferation , migration , and anti apoptotic capabilities . Mechanistically , ILA appears to directly occupy the phosphorylation sites of STAT3 , leading to a reduction in intracellular phosphorylated STAT3 ( p STAT3 ) levels and the inhibition of the HK2 pathway , thereby downregulating glucose metabolism in cancer cells . Notably , this inhibition is independent of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) . In conclusion , our research findings demonstrate that alterations in tryptophan metabolism among CRC patients can influence tumor progression and reveal a novel mechanism through which ILA exerts its inhibitory effects on CRC . These findings offer new insights into the role of gut microbiota in CRC and identify potential clinical therapeutic targets . FAU Zhou , Shizhen
The existence of specialised structures that allow a continuous exchange of CSF between different anatomical compartments at the brain meningeal border is challenging conventional notions around molecular transport within the brain . Experimental findings highlight the conduits and cellular structures controlling the transport of CSF and immune cells between the brain parenchyma ( via the glymphatic system ) , the subarachnoid space ( enclosed by the meningeal pia and arachnoid layers ) , and the outmost meningeal dural layer and calvaria ( via the so called arachnoid cuff exit points ) . Studies in both rodent models and humans show new mechanisms of brain glymphatic molecular transport , meningeal lymphatic vascular drainage , and immune surveillance at the brain draining skull bone marrow and cervical lymph nodes . Pathological alterations at the brain meningeal border have been implicated in disorders of diverse causes , from traumatic brain injury to Alzheimer ' s disease .
The mammalian liver exhibits remarkable regenerative capabilities after injury or resection . Central to this process is the precise modulation of gene expression , driven by changes in chromatin structure and the temporal activation of distal regulatory elements . In this study , we integrated chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic data after partial hepatectomy in mice . We show that the expression of crucial regeneration genes is orchestrated by a diverse array of cis regulatory elements , including regeneration specific enhancers and enhancers repurposed from various developmental stages . These enhancers collaborate to activate the transcriptional programs required for hepatocyte priming and proliferation , with their activity initially regulated by the activator protein 1 ( AP 1 ) complex and ATF3 , and subsequently by nuclear factor erythroid 2 ( NFE2 ) related factor 2 ( NRF2 ) during proliferation . Our results also indicate that hepatic regeneration involves the repression of enhancers regulating liver specific metabolic functions , particularly those involved in lipid metabolism . This study provides a genome wide atlas of enhancer gene interactions , offering new insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying liver regeneration .
In a human cell , DNA is packed with histones , RNA , and chromatin associated proteins , forming a cohesive gel . At any given moment , only a subset of the proteome has physical access to the DNA and organizes its structure , transcription , replication , repair , and other essential molecular functions . We have developed a " zero distance " photo crosslinking approach to quantify proteins in direct contact with DNA in living cells . Collecting DNA interactomes from human breast cancer cells , we present an atlas of over one thousand proteins with physical access to DNA and hundreds of peptide nucleotide crosslinks pinpointing protein DNA interfaces with single amino acid resolution . Quantitative comparisons of DNA interactomes from differentially treated cells recapitulate the recruitment of key transcription factors as well as DNA repair proteins and uncover fast acting restrictors of chromatin accessibility on a timescale of minutes . This opens a direct way to explore genomic regulation in a hypothesis free manner , applicable to many organisms and systems .
Enhancing energy utilization by increasing the number or activity of beige adipocytes has the potential to be of therapeutic benefit for a broad range of metabolic disorders . However , knowledge gaps in our understanding of the mouse versus human developmental origins of beige fat have inhibited the generation of robust preclinical models , leaving a barrier to the success of therapies . Here , we report that a distinct inguinal beige adipose tissue ( ibAT ) depot lineage traces to the same Prx1+ cell origins as inguinal white adipose tissue ( iWAT ) but maintains higher thermogenic activity and capability during aging . We discovered that ibAT has the morphological appearance of human supraclavicular brown adipose tissue ( scBAT ) and , importantly , conserved molecular markers and developmental origins with human scBAT . Our findings reveal a distinct mouse beige adipose tissue depot and provide a preclinical model of human beige adipose tissue development and maintenance .
Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 ( IDH ) mutations are early initiating events in acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . The complex clonal architecture and cellular heterogeneity in IDH mutant AML underlies the heterogeneous clinical presentation and outcomes . Integrating single cell genotyping and transcriptomics , we demonstrate a stem like and inflammatory phenotype of IDH mutant AML and identify clone specific programs associated with NPM1 , NRAS , and SRSF2 co mutations . Furthermore , these clones had distinct responses to treatment with combination IDH inhibitors and chemotherapy , including elimination , reconstitution of myeloid differentiation , or retention within progenitor populations . At relapse after IDH inhibitor monotherapy , we identify upregulated stemness , inflammation , mitochondrial metabolism , and anti apoptotic factors , as well as downregulated major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigen presentation . At the pre leukemic stage , we observe upregulation of IDH2 associated pathways , including inflammation . We deliver a detailed phenotyping of IDH mutant AML and a framework for dissecting contributions of recurrently mutated genes in AML at diagnosis and following therapy , with implications for precision medicine .
Marine non cyanobacterial diazotrophs ( NCDs ) are widespread in the oceans , but the processes controlling nitrogen fixation in cell populations remain understudied . In this study , we combined high throughput sequencing , genetic and physiological characterization , and single cell quantification of nitrogenase expression to investigate the growth strategies of the marine NCD Vibrio diazotrophicus . We demonstrate that this marine NCD is highly versatile , capable of utilizing a broad range of organic and inorganic nitrogen sources . Quantitative fluorescence microscopy revealed intense posttranscriptional regulation of nitrogenase expression and that V . diazotrophicus regulates both the proportion of cells and their nitrogenase expression levels based on ammonium concentration in an NtrC dependent manner . We also found that this phenotypic heterogeneity in nitrogenase expression is more widespread among marine NCDs , suggesting it is a conserved trait . These findings help explain their high abundance in the oceans and deepen our understanding of their ecological importance .
Chronic inflammation and gut barrier breakdown contribute to the progression of metabolic syndrome and affect the development of cardiometabolic diseases , especially in persons consuming low quality diets with limited bioactive compounds . Almonds are a rich source of bioactive compounds with antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties . We hypothesize almond consumption can help disrupt metabolic syndrome progression by improving gut and cardiometabolic health and decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress . To test this hypothesis , adults with metabolic syndrome were randomized to consume either almonds ( 2 oz , whole , dry roasted , n = 38 ) or crackers ( control , equal caloric content , n = 39 ) , as a daily snack for 12 weeks , and samples were collected ( 0 , 4 , and 12 weeks ) . Compared with participants consuming crackers , almond consumption resulted in lower plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations , a modest improvement in waist circumference ( week 4 ) , and improved dietary intakes of alpha tocopherol , soluble fiber , copper , biotin , magnesium , polyunsaturated fatty acids , and monounsaturated fatty acids . Almond consumption raised plasma alpha tocopherol concentrations ( relative to cholesterol concentrations ) and increased excretion of a vitamin E biomarker ( alpha CEHC ) . Almond consumption improved biomarkers of gut barrier function and intestinal inflammation ( fecal calprotectin , myeloperoxidase ) in participants with elevated inflammation at baseline . Total body weight , caloric intake , and markers of carbohydrate metabolism ( glucose , insulin ) , systemic inflammation ( plasma interleukin 6 , C reactive protein , lipopolysaccharide binding protein , CD14 ) , and oxidative damage ( malondialdehyde ) were not altered by almond consumption . In conclusion , daily almond snacking improves nutrient intake and decreases gut inflammation in participants with metabolic syndrome . These beneficial dietary and inflammatory changes may contribute to the improvements in cardiovascular health observed .
BACKGROUND & AIMS : Recent evidence suggests that gut microbiota has a potential role in the pathophysiology of obesity and other cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factors , including hypertension , dyslipidemia , and type 2 diabetes . However , clinical trials evaluating the effects of probiotics supplementation on these outcomes have found inconsistent results , probably due to the wide heterogeneity in trial designs . In addition , there is a lack of studies investigating whether probiotics can enhance the beneficial effects of caloric restriction in individuals with increased risk of CVD as individuals with hypertension and excess body adiposity . Thus , the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of multi strain probiotics supplementation on body adiposity , glycemic homeostasis , lipid profile , and serum adipokine levels in individuals with hypertension and excess body weight following an energy restricted diet . METHODS : A randomized , double blind , placebo controlled clinical trial was conducted for 12 weeks . Were included 66 individuals aged between 40 and 65 years ; both sexes ; body mass index ( BMI ) >/= 25 and < 40 kg/m and diagnosis of hypertension . Were excluded smokers ; individuals using probiotics , prebiotics , symbiotics and antibiotics in the last 3 months ; presenting diabetes , chronic kidney disease or liver failure ; and pregnant and lactating women . Participants were allocated into 2 groups : group with supplementation of 8 probiotic strains in capsules ( 3 x 10 CFU/day ) or control group ( placebo capsules ) . Both groups followed a low calorie diet . Participants underwent anthropometric , body composition ( dual energy radiological absorptiometry ) and biochemical ( glucose metabolism , lipid profile , adiponectin , and leptin ) evaluation at baseline and at the end of the study . RESULTS : After 12 weeks of intervention , the probiotics group presented : a ) reduction of body weight , BMI , circumferences of waist , hip and neck and waist to height ratio ; b ) decrease in total fat mass ( kg ) ; and c ) reduction of glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) . In the control group , it was observed : a ) significant reduction in all anthropometric variables ; b ) significant reduction in total fat mass ( kg and % ) , trunk fat mass ( kg ) , visceral fat and load capacity index . In the comparison between groups , there was a higher decrease in HbA1c in the probiotics group ( p < 05 ) . CONCLUSION : Multi strain probiotics supplementation associated with energy restriction in individuals with excess body weight and hypertension promoted a significant improvement in glucose homeostasis assessed by HbA1c . The clinical trial was registered at www . ensaiosclinicos . gov . br : RBR 7jw4ry .
BACKGROUND & AIMS : Metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis ( MASH ) is a significant public health concern , with macrophage phenotypes implicated in its progression . Although extensive inflammation suppressing circular RNA ( ciR EIS , formerly named as hsa_circ_0008882 ) has been implicated in inflammation regulation , its role in macrophage polarization within the context of MASH remains unexplored . This study aimed to clarify the effect of ciR EIS on macrophage polarization in MASH . METHODS : Immunofluorescence fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to evaluate the localization of ciR EIS in human liver sections . THP 1 derived macrophages ( TDMs ) were utilized to study ciR EIS functions in vitro . Flow cytometry and RT qPCR were employed to evaluate macrophage polarization after transfection . Bodipy assay was used to measure lipid buildup in HepG2 cells . Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm liver insulin like growth factor 1 ( IGF1 ) expression . Retrospective clinical records were analyzed to examine the association between cir EIS , IGF1 , and MASH . RESULTS : CiR EIS was downregulated in patients with MASH and colocalized with the macrophage marker CD CiR EIS and mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase 5 ( MT ND5 ) were downregulated in M1 macrophages and upregulated in M2 macrophages . TDM derived supernatants overexpressed ciR EIS , significantly reducing HepG2 lipid deposition and inhibiting LX2 proliferation . Overexpression of ciR EIS in TDMs significantly inhibited M1 macrophage markers CD86 , interleukin 1 beta , and tumor necrosis factor alpha while enhancing M2 macrophage markers CD163 and CD CiR EIS regulated macrophage polarization in a manner involving the miR 548m/IGF1 axis . Serum IGF1 levels were positively correlated with ciR EIS , and both of them were notably reduced in patients with MASH and inversely correlated with APRI and FIB 4 scores . CONCLUSIONS : CiR EIS regulates macrophage polarization in a manner involving the miR 548/IGF1 axis , thereby reducing hepatocyte lipid accumulation and stellate cell proliferation in MASH . It demonstrates potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for MASH .
OBJECTIVE : Improving maternal health is key to saving lives of women who would otherwise die due to pregnancy and childbirth related complications , especially in developing countries . The timed and targeted counseling ( ttC ) approach , delivered by community health workers , is a behavioural change counseling approach for improving maternal health . This approach focuses on giving stage appropriate messages to pregnant women regarding the timing of antenatal care visits , where to deliver and postnatal care . The purpose of this study therefore is to examine the impact of ttC on the maternal health continuum of care outcomes in Northern Uganda . METHODS : A cross sectional quasi experimental design with propensity score matching ( PSM ) analysis was used with retrospective data collection comparing an intervention group ( Aber subcounty ) to a comparison group ( Otwal subcounty ) in Northern Uganda . PSM was done to determine the causal relation between ttC and the maternal health outcomes . The primary outcome measures were having four or more antenatal care visits ( 4+ ANC ) , delivery at the advised place of delivery ( PoD ) and having ( at least one ) postnatal care ( PNC ) visit . RESULTS : The PSM analysis showed that participants receiving ttC were significantly more likely to have 4 + ANC attendance ( OR = 61 , 95 % CI 4 8 ) , PoD ( OR = 36 , 95 % CI 4 1 ) and PNC ( OR = 67 , 95 % CI 0 7 ) than participants receiving care as usual . CONCLUSION : Implementation of ttC in similar low resource settings likely leads to improved maternal health continuum of care outcomes and therefore the government of Uganda should integrate ttC into its already existing health care system for more effective maternal health .
BACKGROUND : Previous studies have found that exposure to fine particulate matter ( PM ( 5 ) ) is associated with metabolic alterations , but the specific effects of its composition on metabolic changes remain unclear . OBJECTIVE : To identify key metabolites associated with PM ( 5 ) exposure and its elemental components , with validation through animal experiments . METHODS : A total of 112 healthy older adults were enrolled in the cross sectional study between winter 2020 and summer Individual PM ( 5 ) exposure levels were quantified by personal samplers , and ten trace elements in PM ( 5 ) were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP MS ) . Animal experiments were conducted on male rats to validate the associations between PM ( 5 ) , its elemental composition , and metabolomic changes . Fasting venous blood samples from participants and rat heart blood were collected for non targeted metabolomic analysis using Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis ( OPLS DA ) and pathway enrichment analysis via MetaboAnalyst RESULTS : PM ( 5 ) exposure was significantly associated with changes in 218 plasma metabolites ( p < 05 ) . Non targeted metabolomic analysis identified 29 and 7 metabolic pathways associated with PM ( 5 ) exposure and trace elements , respectively , primarily associated with lipid metabolism , including linoleic acid metabolism . Significant overlaps of metabolomic pathways were observed in chromium ( Cr ) and PM ( 5 ) . A total of 29 human metabolic pathways affected by PM ( 5 ) exposure were identified in the human study , of which 17 common to both humans and rats , including glycerophospholipid metabolism . These metabolites and pathways are related to metabolic disorders , with PM ( 5 ) related metabolites showing associations with diseases like diabetes ( P = 049 ) . CONCLUSIONS : These findings highlight the important role of Cr in PM ( 5 ) induced metabolic changes , emphasizing the need to monitor specific PM ( 5 ) components for assessing health risks and informing public health policies .
Staphylococcus aureus is both a commensal bacterium and versatile pathogen , capable of transitioning from a benign colonizer to cause invasive disease . Its ability to form biofilm a resilient , highly structured bacterial community plays a key role in chronic infections , including those associated with medical implants and native tissues . The unique microenvironments of these biofilm niches create challenges for the host immune system , complicating pathogen clearance . Immunometabolism , the interplay between immune function and metabolic programming , plays a crucial role in dictating how the host combats S . aureus biofilms . Leukocytes undergo profound metabolic changes in response to biofilm , which can lead to dysregulated immune responses and persistent infection . This review explores recent insights defining the metabolic landscape of immune responses to S . aureus biofilm with a focus on two clinically relevant models , namely , craniotomy and prosthetic joint infection .
Sub optimal sanitary conditions resulting from poor hygiene practices alter amino acid ( AA ) metabolism of pigs , thereby changing their quantitative requirements . Pigs can select a diet that meets their AA requirements over an AA deficient one when given the choice , suggesting potential for self supplementation of AA in conditions that affect AA requirements . The present study investigated whether the self supplementation of AA to compensate for the provision of an AA deficient diet in a choice feeding setting differs for piglets kept under high or low sanitary conditions . To this end , an experiment ( 2 x 2 factorial design ) was performed with 60 weaned female piglets ( TN70 x Tempo ) ( two piglets per pen ) . Piglets were kept under high ( HSC ) or low ( LSC ) sanitary conditions and were offered either a diet deficient in eight indispensable AA ( IAA ) ( LP ( ) ) ( No choice ) or the choice between the LP ( ) and a diet enriched with eight IAA ( LP ( + ) ) ( Choice ) for 19 days . Average daily feed intake ( ADFI ) and average daily gain ( ADG ) were recorded , and blood samples were taken to determine immune parameters . Piglets under LSC had 22 and 38% higher blood leukocyte and monocyte counts ( P < 01 for both ) , respectively , and a 129% higher haptoglobin concentration in serum ( P < 05 ) than HSC piglets . Moreover , neutrophil ( +53% ) and eosinophil ( +43% ) counts were increased in LSC pigs ( both P < 001 ) . Low sanitary conditions piglets had 31 , 44 , and 21% lower ADFI , ADG , and gain to feed ratio , respectively , than HSC piglets during the experiment ( P < 01 ) , while no differences between No choice and Choice treatments on these parameters were observed . Both LSC and HSC choice piglets ingested more of the LP ( ) than of the LP ( + ) diet ( P < 001 ) . The course of the consumption of the LP ( + ) diet in time differed between the two sanitary conditions ( P < 01 for the interaction SC x Period ) : the percentage of LP ( + ) consumed out of the total feed intake from the start to the end of the experiment doubled ( from 5 to 2% ) for HSC piglets , while it decreased from 6 to 4% for LSC piglets . Low sanitary conditions , while decreasing performance and activating the immune system , did not increase the preference for an AA enriched diet . Thus , offering piglets the choice to self select between an AA deficient diet and one enriched with AA above the assumed requirement did neither restore growth performance nor affect immune status when kept under low sanitary conditions .
Most vascular complications occur in persons with a low or moderate calculated vascular risk . We have evaluated the added prediction of the metabolic syndrome ( MS ) to the presence of subclinical vascular disease ( SVD ) , beyond that estimated by the cardiovascular risk calculation . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Cross sectional population based study , in 1 , 061 subjects aged 45 to 75 years , without diabetes or known vascular disease , randomly selected from the Primary Care registries of Madrid ( Spain ) . Vascular risk was calculated using SCORE2 and SCORE2 OP , the presence of MS was determined , and the prevalence of SVD was established by quantification of carotid plaques and ankle brachial index . RESULTS : Of the included population , 2% was at low/moderate risk , 5% at high risk and 3% at very high risk . A total of 1% met the criteria for MS . The prevalence of SVD was 7 , 1 and 4% in subjects at low/moderate , high and very high risk without MS , and 5 , 6 and 6% if they had MS , respectively . The association of MS with the presence of EVS was independent of its separate components . A total of 1% of the participants were receiving statin treatment . Statin use was independent of the calculated cardiovascular risk and much higher in subjects with MS ( 6 vs . 8% ) . CONCLUSION : Subjects with MS have a high prevalence of SVD , independent of the estimated risk . The use of statins is more prevalent in subjects with the MS , and is independent of the estimated cardiovascular risk .
INTRODUCTION : One of the most important emerging complications associated with diabetes is the Metabolic dysfunction Associated Fatty Liver Disease ( MAFLD ) . The liver fibrosis index 4 ( FIB 4 ) is proposed , as a first approach , to screening for cirrhosis in these patients . PATIENTS AND METHODS : All unique patients attended by diabetes in the EDN department of our hospital from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 were included . The FIB 4 value for each patient was obtained retrospectively from the laboratory programme of our hospital . RESULTS : 1259 unique patients with type 2 diabetes were attended , and the prevalence of advanced FIB 4 in these patients was 77% [95%CI : 66 09%] . 580 unique patients with type 1 diabetes were attended , and the prevalence of advanced FIB 4 in these patients was 72% [95%CI : 83 15%] . DISCUSSION : Our study confirms the importance of FIB 4 in people with diabetes to identify patients at higher risk of advanced liver fibrosis . We must highlight that 9% of patients with type 2 diabetes and 5% of patients with type 1 diabetes had an indeterminate FIB 4 result .
OBJECTIVES : To counteract sarcopenia in non Western migrant older adults , lifestyle interventions with increased physical activity and adequate dietary protein intake are promising . However , regular community based lifestyle interventions often lack a culture sensitive approach . The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a newly developed culture sensitive lifestyle intervention on physical performance in non Western Surinamese older adults . DESIGN : A randomized controlled trial . PARTICIPANTS : This study was conducted with 65 non Western migrant participants ( Surinamese , 65 +/ 7 y , 91% female , 82% overweight or obese ) . INTERVENTION : The participants were allocated to the culture sensitive lifestyle intervention ( n = 35 ) or control group ( n = 30 ) . The six month intervention consisted of an exercise training program and a nutritional program , both adapted to the cultural and personal needs of the participants . MEASUREMENTS : The primary outcome was physical performance , measured by 6 minute walking test . Secondary outcomes were timed up and go , 30 seconds chair stand , knee extension strength , single leg stand tests , appendicular lean soft tissue mass , fat mass , protein intake and daily physical activity . Linear mixed models were performed to assess intervention effects with significance set at p < RESULTS : The intervention group improved physical performance by 12% from baseline 440 +/ 62 m to 6 months 492 +/ 73 m compared to 8% in control group from 438 +/ 93 m to 471 +/ 66 m ( +5 m , 95%CI ( 2 ; 9 ) , p = 027 ) . Knee extension strength was significantly better maintained in the intervention group from 273 +/ 71 N to 270 +/ 70 N , whereas the control group decreased knee extension strength by 8% at six months from 262 +/ 78 N to 240 +/ 87 N ( +19 N , 95%CI ( 1 38 ) , p = 040 ) . The intervention group significantly increased protein intake more ( from 63 +/ 21 to 78 +/ 38 g/day ) compared to the control group ( from 72 +/ 25 to 78 +/ 29 g/day ) at three months ( +15 g/day , 95%CI ( 1 ; 28 ) , p = 035 ) . No difference between groups was found for physical activity or the other secondary outcomes . CONCLUSIONS : In non Western migrant Surinamese older adults , a culture sensitive lifestyle intervention improved physical performance , protein intake , and maintained muscle strength , presenting a promising approach to manage sarcopenia risk in this population .

Nanoplastics , as widespread and persistent pollutants , pose a significant threat to the health of organisms . In this study , the impacts of polystyrene nanoplastics on the euryhaline fish , pearl spot ( Etroplus suratensis ) were investigated . Pearl spot were exposed to 0 , 2 , 2 , and 4 mg/L of PS NPs for 14 days and NP accumulation , as well as its impact of accumulation on biochemical and oxidative stress parameters and gene expression were examined . The NP accumulation pattern was different at different exposure concentrations . At 2 mg/L of NP exposure concentration , the accumulation order observed was gills > liver > muscle > intestine > brain > spleen . However , at higher exposure concentrations ( 2 and 4 mg/L ) , the accumulation order changed to intestine > liver > gills > muscle > spleen > brain . Moreover , the accumulation led to considerable variations in biochemical parameters . Glucose , total cholesterol , SGOT , SGPT , and ALP levels increased , while albumin , total protein , and A/G ratio decreased due to NP exposure . Additionally , the antioxidant levels including SOD , CAT , GPx , and TAC , were remarkably reduced . This could explain the higher levels of MDA and PC , as well as the reduced expression of NRF2 and P53 in the NP exposed groups , indicating oxidative damage . The significant increases in cortisol levels and the up regulation of HSP70 indicate that fish experience stress evoked by NP . The NP exposure reduced the IGF1 and CYP1A expression , indicating its potential to impair growth and xenobiotic metabolism . These findings indicate that NPs induce stress , biochemical changes , oxidative damage , inhibited growth , and metabolism disruption in fish . This study is the first to examine the environmentally relevant NPs concentrations on protein damage from oxidative stress , toxic metabolism , and the expression of NRF2 , P53 , IGF1 , and CYP1A in a Cichlid fish .
Chronic liver injury results in fibrosis and ultimately progresses to cirrhosis . Delta like 1 ( DLK1 ) has been implicated in the activation of myofibroblasts derived from hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) in the context of liver injury ; however , the specific cellular origins of DLK1 remain a subject of debate . In this study , we demonstrate that DLK1 originating from HSCs is not essential for liver fibrosis resulting from chemical injury . The Dlk1 gene was expressed at comparable levels in primary hepatocytes and HSCs isolated from normal adult mice . Following liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride ( CCl ) intoxication , Dlk1 expression was markedly upregulated alongside the myofibroblast marker Pdgfrbeta , alpha SMA , and collagen genes in the liver . Conditional deletion of the Dlk1 gene in HSCs via Pdgfrb Cre mediated recombination did not significantly alter Dlk1 expression levels in either normal or injured whole liver . Importantly , the absence of Dlk1 in HSCs did not affect the elevation of plasma transaminases , hepatocyte proliferation , or Pdgfrbeta activation during CCl induced acute liver injury . Moreover , during chronic liver injury and fibrosis , the loss of Dlk1 in HSCs did not influence HSCs activation , collagen deposition , or the expression of collagen genes ( Col1a , Col3a ) . Collectively , our findings suggest that HSC derived DLK1 is not critical for the activation of myofibroblasts and liver fibrosis .
Neuroglobin ( Ngb ) induction offers a promising strategy for mitigating traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) damage due to its intrinsic antioxidant properties and capacity to alleviate oxidative stress . In this study , we employed high throughput bioinformatics analysis to identify specific compounds that modulate Ngb related mechanisms , followed by in vitro evaluation of their effects in astrocyte cultures . Among the compounds screened , A1 and A4 emerged as the most potent Ngb inducers . Immunocytochemistry revealed that A1 significantly increased Ngb intensity by 22 % , while A4 enhanced it by 25 % . Additionally , western blot analysis demonstrated that A1 treatment resulted in a threefold increase in Ngb expression compared to controls . Both compounds also improved cell viability , with A1 increasing viability by 8 % and A4 by 25 % relative to untreated controls . Furthermore , our results indicate that these compounds regulate mitochondrial function , enhancing cellular respiration , and potentially reducing energy demand under basal conditions . The complex interactions between Ngb and mitochondrial components , along with their role in various cellular signalling pathways , highlights the need for further research to fully elucidate Ngb ' s mechanisms of action . In conclusion , compounds A1 and A4 are promising candidates for developing innovative neuroprotective therapies , warranting ongoing exploration of their therapeutic implications .
Psoriasis ( Pso ) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease involving immune dysregulation and epidermal hyperplasia . Annexin A1 ( ANXA1 ) , a glucocorticoid regulated protein , and S100A11 are implicated in keratinocyte function , but their roles in Pso remain unclear . This study translationally elucidates the functional role of ANXA1 and S100A11 in Pso by integrating analyses in human and murine skin biopsies and in vitro assays using human keratinocytes . The expression patterns of the ANXA1 and S100A11 in Pso were investigated using an imiquimod ( IMQ ) induced murine model and human skin biopsies . Furthermore , the in vitro effect of the ANXA1 derived peptide Ac ( ) ( 5 , 25 , and 50 ng/mL ) on IL 17 stimulated human keratinocytes ( HaCaT cell line ) was evaluated . IMQ treated mice exhibited hallmark psoriatic features , including epidermal thickening , mast cell degranulation , and elevated IL 23 levels . Immunohistochemical analyses revealed significant upregulation of ANXA1 and S100A11 in psoriatic skin , with coexpression observed in keratinocytes , particularly in superficial epidermal layers . Transcriptomic analysis corroborated these findings , showing elevated ANXA1 and S100A11 expression in psoriatic lesions compared to controls . In HaCaT cells , IL 17 stimulation reduced ANXA1 and S100A11 levels . Treatment with Ac ( ) at the highest concentrations ( 25 and 50 ng/mL ) significantly reduced viability/metabolism of IL 17 stimulated keratinocytes , while the lowest concentration of Ac ( ) ( 5 ng/mL ) effectively increased ROS production . In conclusion , ANXA1 and S100A11 are key players in Pso , with their expression and coexpression closely linked to disease pathogenesis . Further studies are warranted to explore the clinical implications of targeting the ANXA1/S100A11 axis in inflammatory skin diseases .
l aspartate is a nonessential amino acid involving tricarboxylic acid cycle , amplifying hepatic l aspartate level is a practicable and promising therapeutic approach in treating metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease ( MASLD ) and liver injury induced liver fibrosis . However , fewer compounds have been reported to increase hepatic l aspartate level for ameliorating MASLD in vivo . Asparagine synthetase ( ASNS ) catalyzes the conversion of l aspartate into asparagine , here , we identified a natural molecule , named 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 O Pentagalloylglucose ( PGG ) , from the compound library ( approximately 7133 compounds ) using the free energy perturbation ( FEP ) based virtual screening strategy . PGG showed strong binding affinity ( K ( D ) = 8 muM ) against recombinant human ASNS and inhibited its enzymatic activity ( IC = 1 muM ) , subsequently increased cellular l aspartate level and activated LKB1/AMPK metabolic axis and enhanced lipid oxidation , leading to lipid accumulation suppression in hepatocytes . Correspondingly , treating PGG ( 10 mg/kg/per 2 days , i . p . ) in mice for 6 weeks efficiently corrected high fat and high cholesterol ( HFC ) diet induced bodyweight gained , glucose tolerance impairment , insulin resistance , and all the typical manifestations of MASLD , including hepatic steatosis , liver injury , and inflammation . These therapeutics were associated with decreases in ASNS expression level in liver , leading to increases in hepatic l aspartate level , activation of LKB1/AMPK axis , and improvement of mitochondrial oxidation . These data indicate that increasing hepatic l aspartate level would be a promising therapeutic strategy in treating MASLD , and ASNS would be a novel target for developing anti MASLD agents .
Amino acid nitrogen ( AAN ) , a key contributor to umami taste , plays a central role in flavor development during sufu fermentation . Given the critical influence of microbial metabolism on flavor formation , this study employed metagenomic analysis to investigate the mechanisms of AAN generation . During sufu fermentation , the AAN content increased significantly , reaching a final concentration of 56 g/100 g . Metagenomic analysis revealed that both bacterial ( e . g . , Dysgonomonas macrotermitis , Lactococcus lactis ) and fungal ( e . g . , Rhizopus arrhizus ) species were the core microbiota driving AAN formation . These microorganisms encoded abundant proteases and amino acid hydrolases essential for AAN metabolism . Functional profiling highlighted carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism as the dominant pathways in flavor formation . Notably , glutamate synthesis was associated with pathways ko00220 and ko00250 , mediated by glutamate synthetase ( EC 13 ) and glutamine synthetase ( EC 2 ) . These findings elucidate the microbial enzymatic mechanisms particularly amino acid transformations underlying sufu ' s umami taste development during fermentation .
The preservation of fresh fruits and vegetables ( F&V ) is important to achieve food and nutritional security , reduce food loss , and boost global trade and economic growth . To understand the gamma Aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) impact on F&V quality , this study conducted a meta analysis of 30 articles ( 2020 2024 ) . GABA was found to effectively preserve F&V quality by regulating total soluble solids ( TSS ) , delaying firmness loss , and minimizing browning , microbial spoilage , and chilling injury . These benefits stem from GABA ' s action on key metabolic pathways , including ethylene , cell wall , antioxidant , ascorbate glutathione , GABA , reactive species , phenylpropanoid , polyamine , and energy regulation . Frequency analysis identified effective trends in GABA research : immersion was preferred and best application method with a coverage of 66 % ; optimal GABA dosages were 1 mM 10 mM with a coverage of 33 % ; optimal treatment exposure times were 5 15 min with a coverage of 33 % ; and optimal storage temperatures of treated F&V were 2 degrees C 4 degrees C with a coverage of 60 % . The challenges in GABA research include its inconsistent impact across different types of produce , its dual effects on TSS regulation ( with both increasing and decreasing trends ) , and the lack of structured policies for application in the F&V sector . Future research should explore GABA ' s mechanisms using omics approaches , enhance delivery through nanotechnology or 3D printing , and focus on its integration into commercial postharvest practices .
In 2024 , the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) recommended 114 new medicines for human use , including 48 with entirely novel active substances . These therapeutic agents span diverse areas such as oncology , neurology , infectious diseases , metabolic disorders , and vaccines . Notably , 16 ( 14 % ) of these approvals received orphan drug designation for the treatment of rare diseases . Key milestones included the endorsement of the first drug proven to slow Alzheimer ' s disease progression and the first vaccine to protect adults against chikungunya virus . Regulatory advancements played a critical role , with accelerated pathways facilitating the approval of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs , including novel antibiotics targeting multidrug resistant bacterial infections and therapies for antimicrobial resistance . EMA also made significant strides in addressing medicine shortages by implementing the European Shortages Monitoring Platform ( ESMP ) and enhancing communication with stakeholders for critical drugs such as glucagon like peptide 1 ( GLP 1 ) receptor agonists . This review examines the synthesis and clinical applications of newly approved drugs by the EMA in 2024 , with a focus on their development pathways and therapeutic impact . By analyzing these innovative medicines , the review aims to provide insights into modern drug synthesis strategies and regulatory frameworks , fostering further advancements in pharmaceutical research and development .
The ubiquity and abundance of plastic debris is one of the most significant challenges facing marine environments . Recent research has demonstrated that microplastics are consumed by marine organisms from a wide variety of trophic levels . However , little is known about the sub lethal effects of microplastic exposure on the health of coral reef fishes or their impacts on predator prey interactions . To examine this , we exposed juvenile Ambon damselfish ( Pomacentrus amboinensis ) to one of two types of polystyrene plastic particles ( virgin , or with the plasticizer di ( 2 ethylhexyl ) phthalate DEHP ) , and a control ( no plastic ) . After 2 days ( 6 exposures ) , the initiation of antioxidant metabolism and oxidative defence was quantified . We also exposed the treated juvenile fish to a piscivorous fish ( Pseudochromis fuscus ) in mesocosms over a 22 h period to investigate whether microplastic exposure affected prey survival . Biomarkers associated with oxidative damage and antioxidant metabolism indicated that microplastic exposure had a negative effect on the health of P . amboinensis . Additionally , P . amboinensis exposed to DEHP microplastics showed the greatest levels of oxidative stress and damage , however the magnitude of this was dependent on the number of ingested particles . Interestingly , survival of P . amboinensis did not differ among plastic treatments during mesocosm survival trials . These results highlight that while studies may not find immediate lethal consequences to plastic ingestion , there may be more subtle sub lethal costs that may have ecologically important consequences at later life stages , through energetic impacts on growth and energy allocation .
As a facultative chemolithoautotrophic bacterium , Cupriavidus necator H16 uses the Entner Doudoroff ( ED ) pathway for heterotrophic growth on carbohydrates such as fructose and the Calvin cycle for lithoautotrophic carbon dioxide fixation . In a previous study , we found that an ED pathway deficient C . necator strain can survive on fructose , but the underlying metabolic pathway remained unclear . This study aimed to elucidate the metabolic mechanism of fructose metabolism in this ED pathway deficient C . necator strain . First , the metabolic characteristics of fructose catabolism in the deficient strain were examined . Then , the roles of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis , the Calvin shunt , and the non oxidative pentose phosphate pathway ( non OxPPP ) in the metabolism of fructose were identified through comparative transcriptomic analysis combined with C tracer experiments . Further growth experiments using knockout strains of key genes involved in these pathways confirmed that the non OxPPP compensates for the blocked ED pathway to metabolize fructose and provide a precursor for the Calvin shunt , thereby driving subsequent carbon fluxes . Additionally , phosphoglycolate salvage pathways , particularly the malate cycle , are crucial for recycling glycolate 2 phosphate produced during RuBisCO catalyzed oxidation . This study revealed a novel fructose metabolism mechanism in C . necator and highlighted its metabolic flexibility , thereby deepening our understanding of its carbon utilization strategies and providing a theoretical basis for further metabolic engineering research .
The ecotoxicity of nanoplastics ( NPs ) on marine microalgae has been extensively explored recently , yet the mechanisms driving short term growth improvement caused by NPs remain poorly understood . In the present study , we observed that a relatively high concentration ( 10 mg/L ) of the green fluorescently labeled fresh polyamide polymethyl methacrylate polymer blend ( w/w 21 : 4 ) NPs beads ( 200 nm ) significantly enhanced the cell density of Porphyridium cruentum ( 1 % ) by alleviating reactive oxygen species generation , chlorophyll degradation , and photoinhibition . An increase in the sticky bounded exopolysaccharides ( b EPs ) surrounding P . cruentum surface enhanced NP adsorption within five hours of exposure , with CH bond in phospholipids/glycolipids and polysaccharides of b EPs supporting the adsorption to mitigate photoinhibition . Increased free exopolysaccharides ( EPs ) removed inorganic and organic carbon and 48 % of dissolved organic matter ( DOM ) , encapsulating NPs into sediments while cooperating with pH elevation . However , short term growth promotion resulted in cell shading and phosphorous deficiency after 12 days of cultivation . Consequently , the photosynthesis antenna proteins pathway and energy metabolites were downregulated , whereas the transmembrane transport and receptor activities of phosphate and calcium signal pathways were upregulated to maintain growth , achieving balance in the 1 mg/L group . The significantly upregulated steroid biosynthesis promoted the hydrophobicity of plasma membranes and reduced the permeability for water soluble ions , exacerbating phosphorus deficiency . The downregulation of the Calvin cycle shifted the total carbon metabolism and carbon migration , reducing photosynthesis and respiration but accumulating starch to counteract cell shading and phosphorus deficiency . These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the short term growth stimulation and long term potential toxic effects of NPs on marine microalgae , thus altering marine carbon and phosphorus cycles .
The implementation of mainstream anaerobic ammonium oxidation ( anammox ) can facilitate the realization of carbon neutral wastewater treatment . However , this technology remains challenging owing to the inability to stably provide nitrite . In this study , we developed a novel nitrification and elemental sulfur based partial autotrophic denitrification/anammox ( NSDA ) process for mainstream nitrogen removal . The NSDA system consists of a nitrification reactor and a combined elemental sulfur based denitrification and anammox ( SDA ) reactor . Each reactor was independently initiated and optimized before being integrated . At mainstream nitrogen levels ( 5 +/ 7 mg NH ( + ) N/L ) and 25 degrees C , the NSDA system achieved 1 +/ 7 % total nitrogen ( TN ) removal efficiency , with an effluent TN concentration of 4 +/ 8 mg N/L . The system exhibited a low NO emission factor ( 23 % ) , significantly lower than other anammox based systems . The SDA reactor achieved a nitrogen removal rate of 53 kg N/ ( m . d ) with a short hydraulic retention time ( 2 h ) . Anammox accounted for 3 +/ 0 % of the TN removal in the SDA reactor . Isotope experiments and kinetic analysis revealed the cooperation between anammox and denitrification for nitrogen removal . Polysulfides formed in the SDA reactor enhanced the utilization rate of elemental sulfur . High throughput sequencing identified Thiobacillus and Candidatus Brocadia as the dominant genera of sulfur oxidation and anammox , respectively . The nitrogen and sulfur metabolic pathways were further verified through metagenomic analysis . Overall , the NSDA process provides a stable and efficient nitrogen removal process , minimizing oxygen demand , eliminating organic carbon requirements , and reducing NO emissions compared to conventional nitrification/denitrification . This approach offers a promising solution for mainstream nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment .
Structural derivatization of known leads using the scaffold hopping strategy is a classic approach in pesticide discovery . However , the modificatory universality of lead skeletons profoundly influences the feasibility of this protocol . We herein report development of disulfaneyl oxadiazole bactericides involving beta carboline moieties . Derivative B18 is filtered out to exhibit excellent in vitro antibacterial properties with half maximal effective concentrations of 47 mg/L , 72 mg/L , and 97 mg/L against Xanthomonas oryzae pv . oryzae , Xanthomonas oryzae pv . oryzicola , and Xanthomonas citri pv . citri , respectively . The observed values fall short in comparison to the positive controls thiodiazole copper ( TC ) and allicin ( AC ) . Moreover , in vivo pot studies reveal that B18 demonstrates enhanced curative ( 12 % ) and protective ( 41 % ) efficacy in comparison to the control groups TC and AC . Investigation regarding the mechanism of action indicates that B18 functions through a dual antibacterial approach . It not only interferes with the metabolic pathways of starch and sucrose in bacteria , and boosts the activity of rice defense enzymes while upregulating the expression of pyruvate kinase in the glycolytic pathway , thereby enhancing the plant resistance to bacterial pests .
Retinal neovascularization is the main pathologic feature of ischemic retinopathy , which eventually leads to vision loss and even blindness . Current treatments like laser photocoagulation and intravitreal injection of anti vascular endothelial growth factor A drugs are invasive , expensive , and incompetent . Therefore , it is urgent to explore optimized therapies , particularly eye drops , to improve treatment effects . Our recent study reported that abnormal up regulation of stimulator of interferon genes ( STING ) is closely associated with retinal vascular diseases , and it is highly enriched in retinal endothelial cells with retinopathy . Thus , we evaluated whether endothelial STING affects retinal neovascularization . In addition , we constructed iRGD and TAT decorated nanoparticles ( NPs ) loaded with C 176 ( I/T C NP ) , capable of penetrating the cornea and targeting retinal endothelial cells . The I/T C NP eye drops were applied to the eyes of oxygen induced retinopathy mice , resulting in attenuated activation of the STING pathway . Consequently , retinal neovascularization and vascular tortuosity were effectively reduced , astrocyte activation was prohibited , and pericyte coverage was improved . These observations suggest that I/T C NP eye drops can be a potential solution for the treatment of retinal neovascularization .
The potential impact of stormwater runoff induced loss of triazine herbicides , like atrazine ( ATZ ) , on soil nitrogen cycling remains poorly understood . Bioretention systems ( BRS ) represent effective stormwater control measures ( SCM ) now understood to serve as important ATZ accumulation zones . However , the effects of ATZ exposure on nitrogen removal and greenhouse gas ( GHG ) abatement within BRS remain unclear . In the present study , bioretention columns were established and exposed to ATZ ( 0 25 mg kg ( 1 ) ) for 200 days . The results demonstrated that the accumulation of ATZ led to a reduction in total nitrogen removal efficiency ( by 7 3 % ) while simultaneously causing an increase in GHG emission fluxes ( by 2 % 1 % ) . Moreover , ATZ significantly altered microbial activities , including nitrogen metabolism enzymes ( hydroxylamine oxidoreductase , nitrate reductase , and nitrite reductase ) and the electron transport system ( ETSA ) . Microbial community analysis showed that ATZ reduced the relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria ( Nitrospira and Nitrosomonas ) , along with certain denitrifying bacteria ( Thauera , Terrimonas , and Dechloromona ) . Besides , the compromised function of leaves and roots diminished plant nitrogen uptake , and the application of structural equation modeling ( SEM ) revealed an increased contribution of plants to nitrogen removal . These findings collectively suggest that the widespread presence of triazine herbicides in urban areas could potentially impact the performance of SCMs .
Currently , treating industrial wastewater with complex components and difficult to degrade pollutants has become a focal point for research . In this study , sodium alginate ( SA ) , polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA ) , and shell powder ( SP ) were used as a carrier backbone to embed ferric cobalt modified biochar ( FCBC ) , exogenous acyl homoserine lactone 6 ( AHLs 6 ) , and the salt tolerant strain Stutzerimonas sp . ZW5 , resulting in the preparation of immobilized microbial carriers . Experimental results demonstrated that , under optimal operating conditions , the bioreactor achieved removal efficiencies of 11 % for nitrate ( NO ( ) N ) , 20 % for calcium ( Ca ( 2+ ) ) , 22 % for chemical oxygen demand ( COD ) , 05 % for phosphorus ( PO ( 3 ) P ) , 57 % for copper ( Cu ( 2+ ) ) , and 16 % for bisphenol A ( BPA ) . The rough surface and numerous functional groups of the reactor packing effectively adsorbed BPA and Cu ( 2+ ) , thereby reducing the inhibitory effects of these pollutants on microbial metabolic activity . In addition , FCBC provides mass transfer channels and active sites to enhance electron transfer . The introduction of exogenous AHLs 6 markedly increased the abundance of functional microbial communities and the activity of key enzymes by regulating microbial metabolism , thus improving the removal efficiency of complex pollutants . This research offers new perspectives on treating complex industrial wastewater .
BACKGROUND : The mitochondrial dysfunction and overactive osteoclasts is involved in the progress of osteoporosis . Brevilin A ( BA ) , a sesquiterpene lactone , is a compound extracted and purified from Centipeda minima . It exhibits a range of pharmacological activities , such as anti inflammatory and antioxidant effects . However , its specific impact on osteoporosis remains unclear . The present study is designed to explore BA as a novel osteoclast inhibitor for the treatment of osteoporosis as well as its molecular mechanisms of action via BNIP3 mediated mitophagy . METHODS : The cytotoxicity of BA in vitro was evaluated using the CCK8 assay , while tartrate resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAcP ) staining and bone resorption assays were conducted to examine its effects on osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function . To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which BA targets BNIP3 in osteoclasts , RNA seq , molecular docking analysis , Surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) , qPCR , western blot , mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate ( OCR ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , Single cell sequencing and immunofluorescence staining were employed . In addition , a specific BNIP3 agonist IOX5 , was used to revalidate the inhibitory effect of BA on BNIP To investigate the effects and protective role of BA in modulating BNIP3 on bone loss in osteoporotic mice induced by ovariectomy ( OVX ) , we employed in vivo micro CT scanning and histological immunostaining techniques . RESULTS : Our study demonstrated that BA inhibited RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis in a concentration dependent manner without any cell cytotoxicity . Further , BA abrogated MAPK related proteins and intracellular and mitochondrial ROS level , subsequently inhibiting NFATc1 activity . RNA seq analysis revealed that the molecular mechanism by which BA inhibited osteoclasts is closely related to mitophagy and mitochondrial function . Here , we found that BA suppressed oxygen consumption rate and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation during osteoclastogenesis . This compound abolished expression of ATG5 , SIRT3 , Beclin1 and LC3B . RANKL induced mitophagy associated protein ( PINK1 and Parkin ) were also suppressed by BA . BA interacted with BNIP3 and IOX5 treatment further verified the targeted inhibition effect of BA on BNIP In addition , we found that BNIP3 deficient inhibited osteoclast differentiation related with mitophagy and mitochondrial function . In vivo experiments confirmed that BA significantly prevent OVX induced bone loss associated with BNIP3 mediated mitophagy . CONCLUSIONS : Our study reveals for the first time that BA acts as a novel inhibitor of BNIP3 , which ameliorates osteoclast activity and OVX induced osteoporosis via limiting mitophagy and mitochondrial energy production , suggesting that it could be a novel therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis .
BACKGROUND : Targeting metabolic disorders has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . 18beta glycyrrhetinic acid ( 18beta GA ) is known for its metabolic regulatory and antioxidant effects in various diseases . However , the precise effects and underlying mechanisms of 18beta GA on CKD remain unclear . PURPOSE : This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of 18beta GA on CKD and to identify the molecular targets of 18beta GA with a particular emphasis on its role in metabolic regulation . STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS : A high fat diet induced CKD model was established to investigate the influence of 18beta GA on lipid metabolic disorders , cellular senescence and fibrosis in the kidneys . Co immunoprecipitation was performed to investigate the impact of 18beta GA on the interaction between transcription factor EB ( TFEB ) and sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1 ) . Additionally , network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses were conducted to identify the specific target proteins of 18beta GA . RESULTS : 18beta GA alleviated renal lipid accumulation , tubular cell senescence and renal interstitial fibrosis in CKD mice . Treatment with 18beta GA largely restored mitochondrial function and attenuated intracellular lipotoxicity and associated cellular senescence by promoting lipophagy in renal tubular cells . Mechanistically , 18beta GA acting as a partial antagonist of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) enhanced lipophagy through SIRT1 mediated nuclear translocation of TFEB which induced the expression of microtubule associated protein light chain 3 ( LC3 ) . CONCLUSION : Our findings demonstrate that 18beta GA , functioning as a partial antagonist of PPARgamma , counteracts CKD progression by activating the SIRT1 TFEB LC3 signaling axis mediated lipophagy and thus uncover a novel mechanism by which 18beta GA improves renal lipid metabolism disorders and exerts renoprotective effects . These results highlight the potential of 18beta GA as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment and prevention of CKD .
BACKGROUND : Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by learning and memory impairments , primarily caused by excessive beta amyloid protein ( Abeta ) accumulation , which induces neurotoxicity and metabolic dysfunction . Gastrodia elata ( GE ) , a medicinal herb , has demonstrated antioxidant , antidepressant , and neuroprotective properties , making it a promising candidate for treating neurological diseases . However , systematic studies on its active compounds improving learning and memory through targeted metabolomics remain limited . PURPOSE : This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Gastrodia elata ( GE ) and its active compounds , with a specific focus on learning and memory impairments in Alzheimer ' s disease . METHODS : Using Caenorhabditis elegans ( C . elegans ) models of AD , the effects of GE and its active compounds were assessed through chemotaxis assays , targeted metabolomics , and LC QQQ MS analysis . Key neurotransmitter levels , including l Leucine ( l Leu ) , l Phenylalanine ( l Phe ) , gamma aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , and Acetylcholine ( ACh ) , were quantified . The study also utilized principal component analysis ( PCA ) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis ( OPLS DA ) to investigate metabolic biomarkers . RESULTS : Parishin E ( BG E ) was identified as the most effective compound in reducing Abeta levels and modulating key biomarkers associated with learning and memory impairments . LC QQQ MS analysis showed that BG E restored neurotransmitter levels closer to those of healthy controls . GE extracts ( 100 mug/ml ) and the positive control Huperzine A ( Hup A , 8 mug/ml ) significantly delayed paralysis in AD C . elegans models . PCA and OPLS DA analyses confirmed that BG E normalized metabolic biomarkers and key neurotransmitter levels associated with AD . CONCLUSION : These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of Gastrodia elata , particularly its active compound Parishin E ( BG E ) , in mitigating learning and memory impairments in Alzheimer ' s disease . This study provides a foundation for further validation in advanced models and supports the development of natural therapeutics for neurological disorders .
AIMS : Sepsis is characterized by a systemic inflammation disorder and multi organ dysfunction caused by infection . Glucocorticoids ( GCs ) , as anti inflammatory properties drugs , are widely used for the management of patients with inflammatory diseases , including sepsis . However , the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanisms of GCs on sepsis remain incompletely understood . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Mouse sepsis models were constructed using intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and treated with synthetic GC dexamethasone ( DEX ) . Systemic inflammation and organ injury were evaluated by histological staining , immunophenotypic analysis , and detection of inflammatory cytokines . Inflammatory signaling pathways were identified by western blot ( WB ) and RT qPCR . Finally , targeted metabolomics were conducted to examine metabolic changes . KEY FINDINGS : Subcutaneous administration of DEX significantly alleviate LPS induced acute organ injury and systemic inflammation , thereby reducing mortality in septic mice . DEX substantially reduced the amounts of intrahepatic neutrophils/macrophages , and inflammatory cytokines expressions in the livers of septic mice and in LPS stimulated bone marrow derived macrophages ( BMDMs ) . Mechanistically , DEX inhibit JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway both in livers and BMDMs . Pharmacological inhibition of JAK1 or STAT3 via Upadacitinib or Stattic , respectively , partially mimic the anti inflammatory function of GC , including the reduction of intrahepatic macrophages , proinflammatory cytokines production , and mortality in septic mice . Additionally , DEX could also promote the rewiring of tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle in the livers of septic mice . SIGNIFICANCE : This study provides important insights into the molecular and metabolic mechanisms underlying GCs mediated anti inflammatory reactions .
OBJECTIVE : Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) has become a common health problem among middle aged and elderly people in China . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of physical activity on renal function in Chinese middle aged and elderly people . STUDY DESIGN : Nationwide cohort study . METHODS : 3599 participants in the 2011 China Health and Aging Longitudinal Study ( CHARLS ) were used in the cross sectional study , with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) < 60 ml/min/73 m as the endpoint event . 2309 participants in the 2015 CHARLS were used in the longitudinal study , with eGFR <60 ml/min/73 m or >/=25 % decrease in eGFR as the endpoint events . 2190 participants from the longitudinal study , after excluding those with baseline eGFR < 60 ml/min/73m2 , were included in a sensitivity analysis to reassess the associations . Physical activity intensity was assessed by self report . Associations between physical activity levels and renal function were analyzed using logistic regression . RESULTS : In cross sectional analyses , engaging in moderate ( MPA ) or vigorousphysical activity ( VPA ) for more than 300 min/week was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of renal endpoint events compared to physically inactive participants ( OR = 39 , 95 % CI : 30 51 ) . After correction for clinical characteristics and blood test results , VPA and MPA >300 min/week remained independent protective factors for renal function . In the longitudinal cohort , VPA and MPA >300 min/w reduced the risk of renal endpoint events by 45 % ( OR = 55 , 95 % CI = 38 80 ) . After correcting for clinical characteristics and blood test results , VPA and MPA >300min/w still reduced the risk of renal endpoint events by 37 % ( OR = 63 , 95 % CI = 43 92 ) and 39 % ( OR = 61 , 95 % CI : 42 89 ) , respectively . Sensitivity analysis further confirmed the robustness of these findings , with VPA and MPA > 300 min/week consistently identified as independent protective factors . CONCLUSIONS : Physical activity is associated with a reduced risk and delayed onset of renal insufficiency . The results of this study provide additional evidence for the renoprotective effects of exercise in non CKD populations .
The requirement for carbon neutrality and bioresource recovery has shifted our views on water treatment from health and pollution avoidance to one of sustainability with water and nutrient circularity . Despite progress , the current process of wastewater treatment is linear , based on core aerobic microbiology , which is unlikely to be carbon neutral due to its large use of energy and production of waste sludge . Here , we outline a shift from aerobic to anaerobic microbiology at the core of wastewater treatment and resource recovery , illustrating the state of the art technologies available for this paradigm shift . Anaerobic metabolism primarily offers the benefit of minimal energy input ( up to 50% reduction ) and minimal biomass production , resulting in up to 95% less waste sludge compared with aerobic treatment , which is increasingly attractive , given dialogue surrounding emerging contaminants in biosolids . Recent innovative research solutions have made ambient ( mainstream ) anaerobic treatment a ready substitute for the aerobic processes for municipal wastewater in temperate regions . Moreover , utilising anaerobic treatment as the core carbon removal step allows for more biological downstream resource recovery with several opportunities to couple the process with ( anaerobic ) nitrogen and phosphorus recovery , namely , potential mainstream anaerobic ammonium oxidation ( anammox ) and methane oxidation ( N DAMO ) . Furthermore , these technologies can be mixed and matched with membranes and ion exchange systems , high value biochemical production , and/or water reuse installations . As such , we propose the reconfiguration of the wastewater treatment plant of the futurewith anaerobic microbiology . Mainstream anaerobic treatment at the core of a truly sustainable platform for modern municipal wastewater treatment , facilitating circular economy and net zero carbon goals .
Salt stress is one of the abiotic factors limiting crop growth . However , the mechanisms regulating starch sucrose metabolism in the mobilization of soybean ( Glycine max L . ) reserves at different levels of salt stress during germination remain unknown . This study evaluated the effects of different levels of salt stress [0 mmol L ( 1 ) NaCl ( CK ) , 75 mmol L ( 1 ) NaCl ( S ) , and 150 mmol L ( 1 ) NaCl ( SS ) ] on germinating seeds of three soybean varieties . Salt stress , especially the SS treatment , significantly reduced the radicle length , radicle fresh weight , and total fresh weight . Salt stress had different effects on the starch accumulation of cotyledons and radicles , while significantly increased the sucrose accumulation through several mechanisms . The regulatory mechanisms governing starch sucrose metabolism in cotyledon and radicle during the germination stage exhibit distinct differences . In cotyledons , the decrease of starch content under S and SS treatment was due to the decrease of sucrose decomposition , which inhibited the metabolic cycle of starch . The up regulated expression of GmSWEET6/15 under different levels of salt stress can promote the accumulation of sucrose in radicles . However , different salt stress levels have different response mechanisms to sucrose and starch metabolism in radicles . The activities of sucrose metabolizing enzymes sucrose synthase ( cleavage ) and invertase in the radicle of S treatment were significantly reduced , while SS treatment could activate the sucrose metabolic cycle and increase the efficiency of starch sucrose conversion . Compared with S treatment , the accumulation of starch content in SS treatment was due to the increase of SSS , alpha amylase and beta amylase activities and the up regulation of GmAMY3 and GmBAM1 expression levels . Based on the results of this study , in order to promote soybean germination in saline soils , rationalized soybean seed compositions can be designed according to the degree of salinity in each region , which can provide a reference to the future breeding of salt tolerant soybeans .
OBJECTIVES : Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide , with its prevalence exacerbated by inadequate nutritional intake . Particularly concerning is the elevated risk induced by imbalanced nutrition during development , which can impact lifelong heart health . Recent research has underscored mitochondrial dysregulation as a pivotal mechanism driving the enduring consequences of nutritional excess . Building upon previous findings wherein a maternal high fat diet ( HFD ) led to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis , our current study aimed to evaluate the impact of such a challenge on myocardial mitochondrial function . METHODS : Female rats were fed a chow diet or HFD during gestation and lactation . The hearts of male offspring were analyzed at adulthood . Mitochondrial DNA abundance was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction . Proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis , fusion , fission , damage to the electron transport chain , metabolism , cell death , proliferation , and inflammation were measured by western blot . Mitochondrial clearance was evaluated by the measurement of mitophagy markers on isolated mitochondria . Lipids were visualized by histologic approaches . RESULTS : We detected decreased cardiac mitochondrial fission factor and mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthase beta subunit and increased Parkin , pro tumor necrosis factor alpha , and pro interleukin 1 beta protein levels associated with decreased microtubule associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B levels in cardiac mitochondrial fraction , with a tendency for increased Oil Red O staining in the adult hearts of male offspring exposed to HFD . CONCLUSIONS : Maternal exposure to HFD enhanced mitochondrial damage and impaired fission and clearance in offspring hearts at adulthood . These alterations were associated with altered expression of proteins involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain coupled with a propensity for increased fatty acid accumulation and elevated proinflammatory markers .
4 Bromo 2 , 5 dimethoxyphenethylamine ( 2C B ) is widely used recreationally and has recently gained interest as a treatment for mental health disorders . In this study , a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method to quantify 2C B and its metabolites 4 bromo 2 , 5 dimethoxyphenylacetic acid ( BDMPAA ) and 4 bromo 2 hydroxy 5 methoxyphenylacetic acid ( B 2 HMPAA ) in human plasma was developed and validated . Moreover , pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on samples from clinical study participants who received 30 mg of 2C B . The metabolic degradation of 2C B and its metabolites via monoamine oxidases ( MAOs ) , cytosolic enzymes , and cytochrome P450 enzymes was assessed and their activation potencies at the serotonin 2A receptor were investigated . Optimal chromatographic separation was achieved using a Kinetex 6 mum XB C18 analytical column and a mobile phase gradient of water and acetonitrile supplemented with 1% formic acid . Using electrospray ionization , a linear range of 5 100 ng/mL for 2C B , 5 1000 ng/mL for BDMPAA , and 5 1000 ng/mL for B 2 HMPAA was achieved . The method demonstrated high accuracy , precision , and extraction recovery with minimal matrix effects . MAO A , MAO B , cytosolic enzymes , and CYP2D6 were identified as key enzymes involved in the metabolic degradation of 2C B . Unlike 2C B , BDMPAA and B 2 HMPAA did not activate the human serotonin 2A receptor , suggesting that these metabolites do not contribute to the psychedelic effect . This study provides insights into the pharmacokinetics , metabolism , and pharmacological activity of 2C B and its metabolites . The validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method offers a reliable tool for future clinical studies investigating the therapeutic potential and metabolism of 2C B . SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT : A rapid and nonlaborious liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for pharmacokinetic analysis of 4 bromo 2 , 5 dimethoxyphenethylamine ( 2C B ) and its metabolites 4 bromo 2 , 5 dimethoxyphenylacetic acid and 4 bromo 2 hydroxy 5 methoxyphenylacetic acid in human plasma . To assess the metabolites ' relevance in psychedelic drug action , serotonin 2A receptor activity was studied . Unlike 2C B , the metabolites failed to activate the receptor . Monoamine oxidase A and B , and cytosolic enzymes were confirmed in 4 bromo 2 , 5 dimethoxyphenylacetic acid formation , whereas CYP2D6 was found to metabolize 2C B through a minor pathway .

The polarity of lipid droplets ( LDs ) is a key indicator of their state and function , playing a crucial regulatory role in diverse biological processes . However , aberrant changes in LDs polarity can disrupt lipid metabolism , resulting in LDs dysfunction and contributing to the development of various diseases , such as obesity , fatty liver and diabetes . Consequently , it is imperative to monitor and track changes in LDs polarity within organisms . Herein , we constructed a D pi A structure fluorescence probe HAB , using a phenothiazine ( PTZ ) derivative as electron donor and 4 pyridine acetonitrile as electron acceptor . This probe accurately monitored the polarity of LDs through the intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT ) mechanism . Especially , probe HAB exhibited high specificity and sensitivity towards polarity , a significant Stokes shift , and the maximum emission wavelength falling within the near infrared ( NIR ) region . Within a certain range , both the maximum emission intensity and the maximum emission wavelength of probe HAB exhibited a strong linear correlation with the polarity parameters ( Deltaf ) . Furthermore , HAB displayed minimal cytotoxicity and enabled wash free imaging . The probe has high specificity for LDs and could effectively detect the formation and dynamic behavior of LDs . In addition , it successfully monitored changes in LDs polarity under conditions of ferroptosis and anticancer drug therapy . These findings underscore its significant potential for diagnosing non alcoholic fatty liver disease and tumors , thereby highlighting its value in both disease diagnosis and biological research .
The effect of water management on methane ( CH ) emissions from paddy has been well documented , yet the impact of Precision Aerobic Irrigation ( PAI ) on methanogens and methanotrophs communities , as well as their metabolic types , remain unclear . This study utilized two different irrigation regimes ( ( continuous flooding ( CF ) and PAI ) to elucidate the impacts of PAI on the community structure and metabolism of methanogens and methanotrophs . The results indicated that PAI significantly reduced irrigation water use by 23 % , decreased CH cumulative emissions by 64 % , and increased rice yield by 06 % . Additionally , the PAI treatment enhanced the soil ' s redox potential ( Eh ) and reduced the total root secreted organic acids ( TOA ) . Redundancy analysis revealed significant differences in the community structures of methanogens and methanotrophs between PAI and CF treatments , which were associated with Eh , TOA , and organic acid types ( P < 05 ) . At the tillering stage , PAI significantly decreased the proportion of facultative methanogens while increasing acetoclastic methanogens . Structural equation modeling indicated that the metabolic types of methanogens are regulated by Eh and organic acids , with a significant positive effect on CH emission . In conclusion , our findings demonstrate that PAI reduces CH emissions from paddy fields by enhancing Eh and altering the secretion of root derived organic acids , thereby regulating the community structure and metabolic types of methanogens and methanotrophs .
Anaerobic fermentation offers a sustainable and eco friendly approach to converting food waste ( FW ) into high value volatile fatty acids ( VFAs ) . Although both carbon and metal based conductive materials can enhance VFAs yields during FW fermentation , a comprehensive comparison of these materials and their underlying mechanisms remains unexplored , limiting their practical selection and application . This study systematically investigated the differences between biochar and magnetite , which are representative carbon and metal based conductive materials , in promoting VFAs production during FW fermentation . The results indicated that VFAs yields increased by 106 % and 2 % in the presence of biochar and magnetite , respectively , compared to the control , with notable enhancements during critical fermentation stages , including solubilization , hydrolysis , and acidification . Microbial analysis demonstrated that biochar more effectively enriched electroactive bacteria with acid forming functions ( e . g . , Clostridium was enriched 3 fold more than in the control ) compared to magnetite . Additionally , biochar more efficiently upregulated metabolic pathways associated with VFAs biosynthesis , including pyruvate metabolism ( e . g . , aceE and pckA ) , acetate production ( e . g . , pta and acyP ) , and butyrate production ( e . g . , ptb and bok ) . Biochar also enhanced microbial adaptability to external environmental conditions through quorum sensing ( e . g . , luxS and lsrA ) and two component systems ( e . g . , phoA and atoA ) . The enhanced TCA cycle , which provides electrons and energy for VFAs production and environmental adaptability , was more pronounced with biochar , ultimately leading to increased overall VFAs production . This work provides a deeper understanding about the impact of conductive materials on anaerobic fermentation and offers valuable direction for optimizing FW treatment .

Monascus fermented coix seed exhibits enhanced tocopherol accumulation compared to other strains , yet mechanisms remain unclear . Whether Monascus metabolites/enzymes drive this enrichment is worth exploring . Comparative genomics and transcriptomics were employed to analyze secondary metabolite profiles and tocopherol enrichment capabilities across Monascus strains . The results revealed that gamma aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) derived from amino acid metabolism is channeled into both the Shikimate pathway to generate homogentisic acid ( a tocopherol precursor ) and the Mevalonate pathway to produce ergosterol and geranylgeranyl diphosphate ( another precursor ) . Furthermore , the total tocopherol content of M1 and M1 + 3 reached 168 and 148 mug/g DW , positively correlating with ergosterol content ( p < 05 ) . Transcriptomic data further demonstrated strain specific differences in tocopherol enrichment , linked to upregulated expression of key genes ( HPPD , ERG4 , MVD , FDPS , GGPS1 ) governing precursor biosynthesis . Crucially , we validated that ergosterol acts as a stimulator of tocopherol synthesis , directly supporting our hypothesis on pathway crosstalk . This study elucidates microbial driven tocopherol enrichment mechanisms via precursor allocation and transcriptional regulation , providing insights into bioactive compound synthesis in complex metabolic networks .
This study investigates the response of red and green kiwiberry cultivars ( ' Jumbo ' , ' Bingo ' , ' Purpurna Sadowa ' ) to different storage temperatures , as limited research exists on red fleshed kiwiberry . Basic measurements ( firmness , colour ) and metabolite analysis were performed on fruit stored at 1 degrees C and 6 degrees C . Lower temperatures were confirmed to preserve the physicochemical properties of green kiwiberry , but this may not apply to red kiwiberry . We found that higher storage temperatures did not increase metabolites in green kiwiberry . However , for red kiwiberry , which often has not reached full colour at harvest , higher temperatures are crucial for colour development . These temperatures significantly affect both fruit colour and the levels of metabolites responsible for flavor and attractiveness . Post harvest storage of red kiwiberry is more complex , requiring careful consideration of factors beyond firmness and sugar content , as fruit colour is equally if not more important for marketability and consumer satisfaction .
Metabolic dysfunction associated alcohol related liver disease ( MetALD ) is an emerging clinical entity that reflects the coexistence of metabolic dysfunction and alcohol related liver injury . Unlike classical alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) , MetALD patients often present with lower to moderate alcohol consumption alongside metabolic risk factors such as obesity , insulin resistance , and dyslipidemia . These factors can synergistically worsen liver injury even at lower alcohol intake levels . Alcohol abuse remains a major global health concern , with the liver being the primary target of alcohol ' s toxic effects . Long term alcohol exposure , especially when compounded by metabolic dysfunction , can accelerate the progression from steatosis to inflammation , fibrosis , cirrhosis , and hepatocellular carcinoma . Besides alcohol itself , various factors , including genetic predispositions , gender , type of alcoholic beverage , drinking patterns , and co morbidities such as viral infections ( HBV , HCV ) modulate disease susceptibility and severity . This review summarizes current knowledge of risk factors contributing to MetALD , highlights the synergistic interactions between metabolic dysfunction and alcohol consumption , and discusses potential strategies for disease prevention and management .
Intravenous ( IV ) glutathione ( GSH ) therapy is increasingly used as an antioxidant intervention , often perceived as interchangeable with ozone therapy . However , this article challenges that notion , highlighting significant biochemical differences and uses dynamic modelling , via Ordinary Differential Equations , the authors compare pharmacokinetics of IV GSH versus endogenous GSH production stimulated by ozone . Findings indicate that IV GSH induces non physiological plasma concentrations , causing reductive stress and impairing mitochondrial and immune functions . In contrast , ozone elicits a controlled oxidative stimulus via the Nrf2 pathway , promoting adaptive , physiological GSH synthesis . Despite patient reports of symptom relief with high dose IV antioxidants , these effects may reflect transient metabolic modulation or placebo influence , not sustainable therapeutic benefit . The study calls for a paradigm shift in redox based therapies , emphasizing dose dependent effects and advocating for physiological mimicry over pharmacological excess . Clinicians are urged to critically assess antioxidant interventions , recognizing the potential harms of reductive extremes alongside oxidative ones .
Energy metabolism is crucial for reproduction , and disturbances in glucose metabolism are closely associated with reproductive disorders . The gonadotropin inhibitory hormone ( GnIH ) plays a crucial role in reproduction and glucose homeostasis in both birds and mammals . However , its specific effects on glucose metabolism associated ovarian dysfunction in hens remain uncharacterized . In this study , we investigated the effects of GnIH on ovarian function and glucose homeostasis in hens using combined in vivo and in vitro approaches . Our results showed that GnIH and its receptor , GPR147 , are predominantly expressed in white follicles . Continuous GnIH injection significantly reduced the ovarian index and the number of prehierarchical follicles , concurrently suppressing Fshr and LHr expression in white follicles . Additionally , metabolomic analyses indicate changes in key glucose metabolism pathways , indicating a regulatory role of GnIH in glucose metabolism . To validate our metabolomics findings , the effects of GnIH on glucose homeostasis in ovarian white follicles and granulosa cells ( GCs ) were further investigated through in vivo and in vitro studies . The results demonstrated that GnIH enhanced glucose transport , glycolysis and glycogen synthesis , but concurrently induced insulin resistance , oxidative stress , and mitochondrial dysfunction , ultimately leading to reduced energy levels and apoptosis in ovarian tissues . In summary , our study reveals that GnIH contributes to ovarian dysfunction via glucose metabolism dysregulation in hens , suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorder associated ovarian impairment in chickens .
A series of experiments was carried out to study the effects of blood calcium ( Ca ) concentration on the occurrence of subclinical endometritis ( SE ) in dairy cattle . In Experiment 1 , serum Ca level of 26 cows in the first 24 h after calving was evaluated and correlated with the incidence of SE between 34 and 40 days postpartum . The polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMN ) count was affected by Ca blood concentration in the first 24 h postpartum ( P </= 01 ) . In Experiment 2 , a total of 47 cows retrospectively classified as normocalcemic ( Ca >/=5 mg/dL ) or hypocalcemic ( Ca <5 mg/dL ) were randomly assigned to receive or not oral Ca formate at 6 and 30 h postpartum , and the effects of supplementation on SE incidence were evaluated . The treatment with Ca formate , regardless of Ca concentration , reduced PMN count and incidence of SE between 34 and 40 days postpartum ( P < 05 ) . For each increase of 1 mg/dL in blood Ca , SE incidence decreased by 22 % . In Experiment 3 , five multiparous Holstein cows were enrolled in a 2x2 crossover model and assigned to 1 of 2 treatments : normocalcemic ( Control ) or induced subclinical hypocalcemia ( iSCH ) group . The sequence of treatments for a given cow was either Control iSCH or iSCH Control , followed by a 3 week washout period . The iSCH group received an intravenous infusion of 5 % disodium tetraacetic ethylenediamine Na2EDTA at 500 mL/h for 45 min , while the Control group received 9 % NaCl . Levels of ionized Ca ( iCa ) , total Ca ( tCa ) and Mg were determined immediately before the treatments ( M0 ) , at 15 ( M1 ) , 45 min ( M2 , end of infusions ) and 3 h after the end of treatments ( M3 ) . Furthermore , glucose , insulin , NEFA and BHB levels were determined at M Immediately after the end of the infusions ( M2 ) , all animals received an intrauterine challenge with 300 mug of LPS and , after 3 h ( M3 ) , an endometrial biopsy was performed to determine the expression of IL 6 , CXCL8 and TNF and gene expression of glucose insulin receptors and insulin related genes . Subclinical hypocalcemia was effectively induced ; however , the expression of IL 6 , CXCL8 and TNF in the endometrium did not differ between groups within 3 h after intrauterine LPS challenge . The iSCH group presented a significant reduction in serum BHB levels compared to the Control group , but there were no differences in serum glucose , insulin , NEFA and in the endometrial expression of the INSR , IRS1 , IGF1 , SLC2A1 , and SLC2A3 genes . In conclusion , PMN infiltration and the incidence of SE from 34 to 40 days postpartum is related to blood Ca immediately after calving . Ca supplementation with Ca formate decreases the number of PMNs in the endometrium , reducing SE incidence . In addition , transient iSCH does not cause immediate significant changes in the endometrial expression of key inflammatory cytokines and does not adversely affect the insulin signaling pathway in the uterus within 3 h following an intrauterine challenge with LPS . This study provides valuable insights on the role of blood calcium and oral calcium supplementation during the immediate postpartum period on uterine health and the metabolic and immunological effects of transient induced subclinical hypocalcemia in dairy cows .
Stomata are epidermal pores that control the exchange of gaseous CO and HO between plants and their environment . Modulating stomatal density can alter this exchange and thus presents a viable target for engineering improved crop productivity and climate resilience . Here , we show that stomatal density in Arabidopsis thaliana can be decreased by the expression of a water forming NAD ( P ) H oxidase targeted to stomatal precursor cells . We demonstrate that this reduction in stomatal density occurs irrespective of whether the expressed enzyme is localized to the cytosol , chloroplast stroma or chloroplast intermembrane space of these cells . We also reveal that this decrease in stomatal density occurs in the absence of any measurable impact on the efficiency and thermal sensitivity of photosynthesis , or on stomatal dynamics . Consequently , overexpression plants exhibit a higher intrinsic water use efficiency due to an increase in CO fixed per unit water transpired . Finally , we demonstrate that this enhanced water use efficiency translates to an improvement in vegetative growth and biomass accumulation under water deficit conditions . Together , these results thus provide a novel approach for enhancing plant productivity through metabolic engineering of stomatal density .
Growth hormone ( GH ) and testosterone ( TE ) levels in blood are crucial indicators of human health and performance in clean sports . Deviations from normal levels can signal serious health issues , such as fertility problems , cancer , or pituitary tumors . Existing detection methods for these hormones are often costly , time consuming , and lack portability . In this study , we explored the potential of Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy ( SERS ) in distinguishing blood samples from Sprague Dawley ( SD ) rats injected with exogenous GH , TE and both hormones from those not injected . Then , used artificial neural network ( ANN ) models trained , and validated in predicting levels of these hormones in blood . Blood samples from SD rats injected with GH , TE , both hormones , and non injected rats were analyzed using the SERS method upon 785 nm laser excitation . The recorded Raman spectra from blood of GH and TE injected and non injected rats displayed hormone specific band intensity variations . Additionally , Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) showed temporal changes in band intensities post injection , suggesting hormone induced biochemical alterations . In particular , Raman bands centered around 1378 cm ( ) for all groups , 658 cm ( ) for GH , and 798 cm ( ) for GH and TE displayed significant intensity variations . The ANN models , trained using PCA scores from blood samples with varied hormone concentrations , achieved high predictive accuracy with coefficients of determination ( R > 71% ) and low root mean square error ( RMSE < 6436 ) . Elevated hormone levels were initially observed in injected rats , gradually declining over time , with results aligning closely to those obtained via ELISA kits . This work showed that the SERS method can provide rapid ( ~2 minutes ) , hormone independent detection with minimal sample preparation . This approach demonstrated the SERS method ' s potential for rapid , reliable hormone detection and with customized calibration may be applied in sports doping control , clinical diagnostics , and broader biomedical research .
Sphagnum peat bogs store a large fraction of biologically bound carbon , due to a steady accumulation of plant material over millennia . The resistance of Sphagnum biomass to decay is poorly understood and of high importance for preservation efforts and climate models . Sphagnum peat mostly consists of the polysaccharide rich cell wall of the moss but the mechanisms by which it resist degradation by microbes remain unclear . Here we show that enzymatic saccharification of peat polysaccharides including cellulose and other glucose rich polysaccharides is predominantly limited by access to the substrate . The experimental approach involved biotechnological tools including hydrothermal pretreatment to disrupt and relocate cell wall components . This physical change was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . A cocktail of microbial enzymes ( Cellic ( R ) CTec3 ) designed for industrial saccharification of lignocellulose of vascular plants was used to assess enzymatic digestibility of peat polysaccharides . The glucose yield increased from close to zero for untreated peat to 30% and 50% when pretreated at 160 and 180 degrees C . An overall catalytic rate constant for enzymatic glucose release from peat cellulose of 98 h 1 was calculated using a kinetic model . This is a similar or higher rate compared to cellulose from vascular plant tissues . With an iron content of 2 g/kg dry peat , oxidative inactivation of enzymes is an important factor to take into account . A high inactivation constant of 91 x10 3 h 1 was found for the used saccharification conditions , but the addition of catalase alleviated the oxidative inactivation and increased the glucose yield with 60% in peat pretreated at 180 degrees C . These findings show that molecular structures of Sphagnum peat which prevents access for cell wall degrading enzymes can be disrupted by hydrothermal pretreatment . This brings us closer to understanding peat recalcitrance and thus how very large amounts of organic carbon is stored .
INTRODUCTION : The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID 19 ) pandemic , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS CoV 2 ) , presents a significant global public health threat . Concurrently , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) remains a significant public health challenge . While previous studies have indicated an association between COVID 19 and chronic hepatitis B , the common underlying pathogenesis of these diseases remains incompletely understood . METHODS : To investigate the shared molecular mechanisms between chronic HBV infection and COVID 19 , a comprehensive investigation was conducted using bioinformatics and systems biology . Specifically , we utilized RNA seq datasets ( GSE196822 and GSE83148 ) to identify differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) associated with both SARS CoV 2 and HBV infection . Subsequently , these common DEGs were utilized to identify shared pathways , hub genes , transcriptional regulatory networks , and potential drugs . The differential expression of hub genes in both COVID 19 and HBV was verified using the GSE171110 and GSE94660 datasets , respectively . RESULTS : From the 106 shared DEGs identified , immune related pathways were found to play a role in the development and progression of chronic hepatitis B and COVID Protein protein interaction ( PPI ) network analysis revealed 8 hub genes : CDK1 , E2F7 , E2F8 , TYMS , KIF20A , CENPE , TPX2 , HMMR , CD8A , GZMA . In the validation set , the expression of hub genes was statistically significant in both the COVID 19 group and the HBV group compared with the healthy control group . Transcriptional regulatory network analysis identified 155 microRNAs ( miRNAs ) and 43 transcription factors ( TFs ) as potential regulatory signals . Notably , we identified potential therapeutic drugs for HBV chronic infection and COVID 19 , including progesterone , estradiol , dasatinib , aspirin , etoposide , irinotecan hydrochloride , phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate , lucanthone , calcitriol . CONCLUSION : This research elucidates potential molecular targets , signaling pathways , and promising small molecule compounds that could aid in the treatment of chronic HBV infection and COVID
INTRODUCTION : Insulin resistance ( IR ) is associated with diabetic kidney disease ( DKD ) , and normoalbuminuric patients may present with renal tubular damage associated with insulin resistance ( RTDAIR ) . In this context , the kidney injury molecule 1 ( KIM 1 ) emerges as a useful biomarker for assessing tubular damage . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the role of KIM 1 in the detection of RTDAIR in normoalbuminuric patients , as well as its relationship with HOMA IR . METHODOLOGY : This was a cross sectional study involving 82 normoalbuminuric patients with T2DM , divided into two groups according to HOMA IR . Laboratory tests were performed , and data were analyzed using Student ' s t test . A p value < 05 was considered significant . RESULTS : Patients with higher IR ( HOMA IR >/= 77 ) had increased urinary KIM 1 ( uKIM 1 ) concentrations ( 3 +/ 0 ng/g creatinine ) , which may indicate incipient DKD . CONCLUSION : Increased HOMA IR may be related to elevated uKIM 1 levels , suggesting that IR contributes to the development of RTDAIR . Furthermore , uKIM 1 may serve as a useful biomarker for its detection . FAU Oliveira , Laura Eduarda de
The gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract plays a crucial role in nutrient absorption , motility , and metabolism , while serving as a barrier against pathogens . The intestinal epithelial layer , particularly enteroendocrine cells ( EEC ) , is pivotal in sensing luminal stimuli due to its strategic position . Although comprising only 1% of the GI epithelium , in total EEC comprises perhaps the largest endocrine organ that couples GI luminal stimuli with release of hormones and neurotransmitters such as serotonin , glucagon like peptide 1 ( GLP 1 ) , and peptide tyrosine tyrosine ( PYY ) , which regulate local and systemic physiology . In this review , we use EECs as a model to explore critical intracellular signaling pathways centering around calcium ( Ca ( + ) ) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) . EECs utilize ionotropic and metabotropic receptors to detect luminal stimuli , leading to increased intracellular cytoplasmic Ca ( + ) and altered intracellular cAMP dynamics . Ca ( + ) influx is critical for the exocytosis of signaling molecules . The interplay between Ca ( + ) and cAMP signaling pathways enhances the release of these molecules , affecting both local and systemic responses . We make a point to discuss the conventional and emerging methodologies for measuring Ca ( + ) and cAMP dynamics in EECs , which is a rapidly expanding toolbox , containing genetically encoded indicators and resonance energy transfer techniques . Understanding these signaling cascades is essential for deciphering the complex roles of EECs in GI physiology and their impact on systemic health . FAU Bellampalli , Shreya S
Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) is a globally prevalent metabolic disorder characterized by impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion . Beyond traditional risk factors like lifestyle and genetics , environmental pollutants , including particulate matter , heavy metals , and persistent organic pollutants , have become significant contributors to DM . One of the key mechanistic pathways through which these pollutants exert their effects is the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) , a ligand activated transcription factor that regulates the expression of cytochrome P450 family 1 ( CYP1 ) enzymes . This cascade contributes to increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation , hallmarks of metabolic impairment . Importantly , these environmental pollutants are also linked to epigenetic modifications , including aberrant DNA methylation , histone modifications , and microRNA dysregulation , which further disrupt insulin sensitivity and beta cell function . This review explores the possible mechanistic crosstalk between AhR/CYP1 pathway activation and epigenetic alterations in the context of diabetes development . By integrating findings from epidemiology , in vivo , and in vitro studies , we provide a summary of how environmental exposures may influence diabetes risk through epigenetic mechanisms . Understanding these interactions not only advances our knowledge of DM etiology but also highlights novel molecular targets for preventive and therapeutic strategies . FAU Matarid , Tasnim R
Postoperative hyperglycemia with ketosis immediately following fourth ventricular medulloblastoma surgery for a non diabetic child with normal intraoperative blood glucose , is an uncommon clinical entity , and has seldom been reported in the literature . We present the management of this rare complication in a child . Surgical manipulation in and around the fourth ventricle and brainstem region may have disrupted central energy metabolic control involving the brain islet axis , leading to impaired glucose homeostasis . Tumor ' s molecular characteristics may have also contributed to altered glucose metabolism . We emphasize the importance of being aware of this rare complication for their safe management .
BACKGROUND : Studies on gadolinium deposition have recently been reported . OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is an increased magnetic resonance signal intensity ( SI ) of the dentate nucleus ( DCN ) and quantification of gadolinium ( Gd ) brain concentrations by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP MS ) test in rats who had undergone multiple administrations of gadoxetic acid and gadobutrol . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Sprague Dawley rats were equally divided into three groups . Eight animals per group received 20 intravenous injections of gadoxetic acid ( 15 mmol/kg ) and gadobutrol ( 6 mmol/kg ) per injection . MRI was performed at 0 , 5 , and 20 weeks . Subsequently , all animals were euthanized and their brains were dissected for Gd quantification by ICP MS . RESULTS : ICP MS revealed higher Gd content in cerebellum tissue after administration of gadoxetic acid compared to gadobutrol ( P < 05 ) . The mean Gd concentrations in the cerebellum were 48 nmol/g gadoxetic acid and 26 nmol/g gadobutrol after intravenous administration . No visually evident enhancement was found after administration of gadoxetic acid , gadobutrol , or saline at any time point . The DCN to pons SI ratios for gadoxetic acid and gadobutrol were not different from the saline control group ( P > 05 , saline vs . gadoxetic acid and saline vs . gadobutrol , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS : Our results demonstrated that gadolinium concentrations in the cerebellum after intravenous gadoxetic acid administration were higher than for gadobutrol . Multiple administrations of gadoxetic acid disodium are not associated with increased SI in DCN .
BACKGROUND : Neuroinflammation is a key feature of Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) pathology . OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to investigate the serum levels of Cytokine 6 ( Cyto 6 ) , Cytokine 10 ( Cyto 10 ) , and alpha tumor necrosis factor ( alpha TNF ) in Alzheimer ' s disease patients and observe the effects of donepezil plus vitamin B12 ( VB12 ) treatment on these cytokines . METHODS AND MATERIALS : Seventy one AD cases and 70 controls with age more than 60 years . Cyto 6 , Cyto 10 , and alpha TNF were measured using the Chemiluminescence Immulite 1000 system , Siemens . Alzheimer ' s disease subjects were treated with donepezil ( 5 mg/day ) plus VB12 ( 5 mg/day ) supplement for 6 months , and serum cytokine levels were reinvestigated . Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software . RESULT : Cyto 6 , Cyto 10 , and alpha TNF values were raised in Alzheimer ' s disease as compared to controls ( P < 001 ) [AD ( Cyto 6 : 27 +/ 76 pg/ml ; Cyto 10 : 2 +/ 48 pg/ml ; alpha TNF : 49 +/ 85 pg/ml ) and Control ( Cyto 6 : 29 +/ 77 pg/ml ; Cyto 10 : 213 +/ 787 pg/ml ; alpha TNF : 18 +/ 65 pg/ml ) ] . After 6 months , a significant decrease ( P < 01 ) was observed in Cyto 6 ( 95 +/ 21 pg/ml ) , Cyto 10 ( 77 +/ 12 pg/ml ) , and alpha TNF ( 67 +/ 00 pg/ml ) levels in AD . CONCLUSION : We conclude that serum Cyto 6 , Cyto 10 , and alpha TNF play an inflammatory role in Alzheimer ' s disease progression . Combined therapy of donepezil and VB12 supplement showed a beneficial effect in reducing inflammation . This study might benefit further research along with molecular follow up studies for development of novel therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer ' s disease .
BACKGROUND : Evidence suggests that liberal transfusion and anemia correction have negative effects on patients with acute brain injuries ( ABI ) . Such patients with indications for decompressive surgeries require precise and real time monitoring technology for estimation of intraoperative hemoglobin in order to assess the need for transfusion . AIMS : The primary objective was to evaluate non invasive hemoglobin ( SpHb ) monitoring as a guide for red blood cell transfusion ( RBCT ) during emergency decompressive craniotomy in ABI patients . The secondary objectives were to evaluate the incidence of postoperative infections , length of ICU stay , duration of mechanical ventilation , 30 day mortality , and extended Glasgow outcome scale ( E GOS ) score at 90 days . METHODS AND MATERIAL : Eighty patients ( aged 18 65 ) with ABI requiring decompressive surgery were randomized into two groups of 40 patients each : group A ( SpHb monitoring group ) and group B ( standard care group ) . They were compared for RBCT management , and postoperative infections , ventilator days , length of stay in ICU , E GOS , and mortality . RESULTS : The number of patients requiring a single RBCT was significantly higher in group A as compared to Group B ( P < 0001 ) . However , patients requiring two transfusions and the total volume of RBCT were higher in group B ( P < 01 ) . Three or more RBCT were required only in Group B ( P 07 ) . The duration of mechanical ventilation was higher in group B as opposed to group A ( P 07 ) . However , there was no significant difference in the hemodynamic variables between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS : The inclusion of continuous SpHb monitoring during decompressive procedures in ABI patients may assist in the optimal management of blood transfusion , thereby reducing transfusion related complications .
Surfactants , as foliar sprays , are widely used to increase the uptake of agrichemicals through plant leaf surfaces . Study of the effects of surfactants on plants has mainly focused on investigation of the mechanisms that underlie changes in droplet behavior on leaf surfaces . However , how surfactants may affect leaf chemical composition is largely unknown . The standard analysis techniques that have been widely used for leaf chemical analyses such as mass spectroscopy require complex and extensive sample preparation and leaf tissue destruction . Here , we have used an advanced technique , synchrotron macro Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transformed InfraRed spectroscopy ( synchrotron macro ATR FTIR ) , which provides a fast , non destructive and in vivo method to capture the leaf surface and enable the chemical mapping of essential functional groups . The development of two Quasar workflows for analyzing complex FTIR data in this study highlights and strengthens the advantages of synchrotron macro ATR FTIR for plant research . We found that the treatment of 5 week old maize ( Zea mays L . ) leaves with a commercial surfactant , Silwet L 77 , resulted in alterations in the FTIR spectral signatures associated with lipids , proteins and carbohydrates commencing 1 h after treatment . The effects of the surfactant on maize leaf water droplet behavior and photosynthetic performance were concentration dependent . Synchrotron macro ATR FTIR is thus a newly emerging and powerful analytical technique for quantitative studies in plant physiology and biochemistry , especially for plant responses to external environmental factors including both abiotic and biotic stresses .
EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in many solid tumors and serves as a key driver of tumorigenesis and metastasis . It is highly expressed in glioblastoma multiforme , the most aggressive brain tumor in adults , and in its stem cells [glioblastoma stem cells ( GSCs ) ] , which contribute to treatment resistance and tumor relapse . In a previous study , we used the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment ( SELEX ) procedure , a method for selecting high affinity nucleic acids to specific targets via iterative selection and amplification , to identify the 2 ' fluorinated EphA2 targeting RNA aptamer A40L and a truncated 30 mer derivative , A40s . Both aptamers were able to inhibit GSC growth , stemness , and migration upon EphA2 binding . Here , by integrating computational and experimental methods , the A40s structure was unraveled and its interaction with EphA2 was investigated . Our model offers a blueprint to accelerate the development of optimized A40s variants , advancing next generation EphA2 targeted anticancer therapies . FAU Diakogiannaki , Isidora
Climate change is exerting significant negative impacts on various sectors , with livestock farming being particularly affected . One of the most pressing challenges in this context is the growing shortage in the availability of conventional fodder . This scarcity has intensified the search for alternative feed sources , with particular interest in underutilized resources often considered waste due to limited knowledge of their nutritional value . This study aimed to assess whether watermelon plant silage ( WPS ) could be used as a forage source in ruminants . The chemical composition of WPS and alfalfa hay ( AH ) was analyzed . Results showed similar protein content ( 1 vs . 9 g CP/100 g DM , respectively ) , with WPS exhibiting higher crude fat content ( 16 vs . 29 g/100 g DM ) but lower hemicellulose ( 95 vs . 6 g/100 g DM ) and cellulose ( 0 vs . 8 g/100 g DM ) content compared to AH . In the first in vitro trial , WPS and AH were incubated independently to compare their fermentation behavior . WPS produced a higher concentration of short chain fatty acids ( SCFA ) ( 9 vs . 0 mM ; P = 304 ) , lower proportions of propionate ( P = 001 ) , and higher proportions of isobutyrate ( P = 001 ) . In a second in vitro trial , a formulated goat diet ( commercial concentrate and AH in a 1 : 1 ratio ) was used as a control to assess the impact of replacing 25% and 50% of AH with WPS . Trends towards higher value were observed in pH and CH4 concentration as AH was replaced by WPS . The study concluded that WPS could serve as a viable fodder to replace AH in conventional goat diets , simultaneously reducing agricultural waste and serving as a regenerative model for implementing circular economy strategies in affected agronomic sectors .
To explore the risk factors influencing vancomycin trough concentration ( [Formula : see text] ) overexposure in critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation and rank the factors , the medical records of 194 mechanically ventilated critically ill patients hospitalized from 12/10/2021 06/10/2024 were analyzed . Among 194 critically ill patients , 83% were male and 17% were female . Univariate analysis showed that oxygenation index ( OI ) , activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) , urea nitrogen ( UN ) , septic shock , heart disease , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , moderate/severe chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , etc . were statistically different ( P < 05 ) . And APTT , OI , CHF and moderate/severe CKD were statistically different in multivariate logistic regression ( P < 05 ) . The receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve constructed for APTT and OI was 7779 ( 95% CI [708 , 848] , P < 001 ) , with a sensitivity and specificity were 99% and 93% , respectively . The consistency index ( CI ) and consistency ratio ( CR ) of analytic hierarchy process ( AHP ) was 0796 and 0885 , respectively , which meets the consistency test standard . The contributions of APTT , OI , CHF and moderate to severe CKD to the overexposure of [Formula : see text] were 0584 , 1899 , 1614 and 5902 , respectively . The overexposure rates of [Formula : see text] in patients with moderate/severe CKD and CHF were 12% and 23% , respectively . With regard to OI , when the cutoff value of OI was less than 245 , the [Formula : see text]overexposure rate was 83% , otherwise , the overexposure rate was 97% . The risk factors for excessive exposure of [Formula : see text] in critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation were ranked as follows : moderate/severe CKD > OI > CHF > APTT .
Numerous studies have highlighted the anti cancer effects of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear . This study focuses on elucidating the impact of the NSAID ibuprofen ( IBU ) on cancer cells exposed to hypoxia , as the hypoxic microenvironment significantly influences tumor progression , metastatic potential , and therapy resistance . Given that carbonic anhydrase IX ( CA IX ) is a key hypoxia associated protein and a promising therapeutic target due to its tumor specific expression , we primarily examined the impact of IBU on CA IX and the transcription factors regulating CA IX expression . We found that IBU downregulates expression and protein level of CA IX in hypoxic colon carcinoma and head and neck cancer cells , resulting in a reduction of membranous CA IX . To elucidate the mechanism of this phenomenon , we analyzed the key CA IX regulating transcription factor HIF 1 and found decreased levels of the HIF 1alpha subunit in IBU treated cells , leading to its impaired binding to the CA9 promotor . Analysis of another transcription factor involved in CA IX expression , NFkappaB , showed suppressed NFkappaB pathway under IBU treatment . Moreover , we demonstrated IBU mediated induction in apoptosis in cancer cells , as well as a decrease in their ability to migrate . Our study is the first to demonstrate that ibuprofen downregulates carbonic anhydrase IX expression in hypoxic colon and head and neck tumor cells by decreasing HIF 1alpha levels . Additionally , ibuprofen impairs key transcription factors NFkappaB and STAT3 , leading to reduced adaptation to hypoxic stress , decreased tumor cell viability , and migration . This indicates its potential as a therapeutic agent in combination therapy for colon carcinoma or head and neck cancer .
Lysine specific histone demethylase 1A ( LSD1 ) is an epigenetic regulator involved in various biological processes , including metabolic pathways . We demonstrated the therapeutic potential of its pharmacological inhibition in glioblastoma using DDP_38003 ( LSD1i ) , which selectively targets tumor initiating cells ( TICs ) by hampering their adaptability to stress . Through biological , metabolic , and omic approaches , we now show that LSD1i acts as an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stressor , activating the integrated stress response and altering mitochondrial structure and function . These effects impair TICs ' oxidative metabolism and generate reactive oxygen species , further amplifying cellular stress . LSD1i also impairs TICs ' glycolytic activity , causing their metabolic decline . TICs with enhanced glycolysis benefit from LSD1 directed therapy . Conversely , metabolically silent TICs mantain ER and mitochondrial homeostasis , adapting to stress conditions , including LSD1i treatment . A dropout short hairpin RNA screening identifies postglycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment to proteins inositol deacylase 1 ( PGAP1 ) as a mediator of resistance to LSD1i . Disruptions in ER and mitochondrial balance holds promise for improving LSD1 targeted therapy efficacy and overcoming treatment resistance . FAU Marotta , Giulia
Major depression is a prevalent and devastating psychiatric disorder . However , our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is limited . Here , we found reduced expression of zinc finger protein with Kruppel associated box and SCAN domains 4 ( Zkscan4 ) in the hippocampi of patients with major depressive disorder and stress susceptible mice . Zkscan4 disruption ( Zkscan4 ( / ) ) was sufficient to induce depression like behaviors following subthreshold social stress . Zkscan4 regulated excitatory synaptic transmission mainly through direct interaction with the Htr2a promoter and the recruitment of glucocorticoid receptors for the transcriptional repression of 5 hydroxytryptamine receptor 2a ( Htr2a ) . Reduced excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and stress susceptibility in Zkscan4 ( / ) mice were restored by pharmacological inhibition , genetic knockdown of Htr2a , or overexpression of the amino terminal SCAN domain of Zkscan4 ( Zkscan4 ( 1 133 ) ) in cornus ammonis region Our findings demonstrate an essential role of Zkscan4 in promoting stress resilience , suggesting a potential antidepressant effect of Zkscan4 ( 1 133 ) .

beta Site amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) cleaving enzyme 1 ( BACE1 ) is the rate limiting enzyme for amyloid beta ( Abeta ) generation and is considered promising drug target for Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) . The co chaperone BAG3 ( Bcl 2 associated athanogene 3 ) plays an important role in maintaining intracellular protein homeostasis by regulating heat shock protein 70 ( HSP70 ) . Here , we reported that BAG3 expression was significantly elevated in AD . It interacted with and stabilized BACE1 by delaying its degradation through ubiquitin proteasome and autophagy lysosomal pathways . BAG3 ( E455K ) and BAG3 ( R480A ) mutations reduced their interaction with BACE SPOT peptide arrays revealed that BACE1 carboxyl terminal peptide fragments bound to the RQ domain of BAG This interaction can be disrupted by BACE1 derived peptide ( Tat BACE1 ( 480 494 ) ) , leading to decreased BACE1 stability . In APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice , Tat BACE1 ( 480 494 ) reduced BACE1 levels , decreased Abeta production , and improved synaptic and cognitive deficits . These findings indicate that BAG3 forms complex with HSP70 and BACE1 to stabilize BACE1 , suggesting that Tat BACE1 ( 480 494 ) , may represent an ideal class of neuroprotective therapeutics against AD .

It is essential to spatiotemporally control the microniche of wound at different healing stages for rapid and scarless healing . Hence , a multifunctional soft hydrogel integrated with programmed drug release capability ( MLVgel ) was fabricated . MLVgel is adhesive and moldable with low friction response , which provides moisture and responses to an infectious environment to deliver bactericidal and antioxidant effects in rat bacterial infection and burn wound models . By release control , instant short term inflammation suppression is combined with sustained mechano transduction signal inhibition . This dynamically modulates immune responses and delays En1 ( + ) fibroblast activation via the YAP TEAD pathway , ultimately facilitating scarless wound regeneration . Genomic analyses showed that the enhanced reepithelization and mechanoregulation by MLVgel during different wound phases are indispensable for its therapeutic outcomes . Last , MLVgel resulted in markedly improved healing in a pig mature scar model , which demonstrated its translation potential . Our results also verified the necessity of programed dynamic regulation in the healing process . FAU Shu , Haozhou
Chronic stress exposure is a primary contributor to the development of anxiety disorders , closely associated with hippocampal dysfunction . However , the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood . Here , using a mouse model of chronic restraint stress ( CRS ) , we observed a notable increase in the activity , rather than its overall expression level , of hippocampal Rap1 , a small guanosine triphosphatase belonging to the Ras superfamily . Pharmacological inhibition of Rap1 activity in the ventral hippocampus ( vHPC ) effectively mitigated CRS induced anxiety . Cell type specific manipulation of Rap1 activity revealed that Rap1 dysfunction in vHPC pyramidal neurons ( PNs ) , but not in astrocytes or interneurons , contributed to CRS induced anxiety like behaviors . Mechanistically , the heightened Rap1 activity in vHPC PNs augmented their intrinsic excitability through Kv2 phosphorylation at the Thr site , which contributes to the onset of anxiety like behaviors in mice following CRS . Overall , our study reveals a previously undescribed anxiogenic effect of Rap1 and highlights it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in stress related mental disorders .

Multiple factors drive biomolecular condensate formation . In plants , condensation of the transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 ( ARF7 ) and ARF19 attenuates response to the plant hormone auxin . Here , we report that actin mediated movement of cytoplasmic ARF condensates enhances condensation . Coarse grained molecular simulations of active polymers reveal that applied forces drive the associations of macromolecules to enhance phase separation while giving rise to dense phases that preferentially accumulate motile molecules . Our study highlights how molecular motility can drive phase separation , with implications for motile condensates while offering insights into cellular mechanisms that can regulate condensate dynamics .

Non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) constitutes over 80% of lung cancer cases and remains a leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide . Despite the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors , their efficacy is limited to 27 to 45% of patients . Identifying likely treatment responders is essential for optimizing healthcare and improving quality of life . We generated multiplex immunofluorescence ( mIF ) images , histopathology , and RNA sequencing data from human NSCLC tissues . Through the analysis of mIF images , we characterized the spatial organization of 5 million cells based on the expression levels for 33 biomarkers . To enable large scale characterization of tumor microenvironments , we developed NucSegAI , a deep learning model for automated nuclear segmentation and cellular classification in histology images . With this model , we analyzed the morphological , textural , and topological phenotypes of 6 million cells across 119 whole slide images . Through unsupervised phenotype discovery , we identified specific lymphocyte phenotypes predictive of immunotherapy response . Our findings can improve patient stratification and guide selection of effective therapeutic regimens . FAU Zheng , Yuanning
Action sequencing is fundamental to behavior . A critical decision for survival and reproduction is whether to repeat a current action or switch to a different one . However , the neural mechanisms governing action repetition and switching remain largely unknown . In mice trained to perform heterogeneous action sequences , we found that the M1 DLS circuit regulates action repetition , while the PrL DMS pathway controls action switching . These distinct functions arise from preferential innervation of striatal D1 SPNs by M1 and D2 SPNs by PrL , respectively . In a Shank3 knockout mouse model of ASD , the D1/D2 innervation ratio in the PrL DMS pathway was reversed , leading to impaired action switching and repetitive behaviors . Genetic restoration of Shank3 in the DMS rescued both physiological and behavioral deficits . These findings reveal how the brain orchestrates action sequencing in health and disease .

The self renewal of intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) is essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and ensuring regeneration of the intestinal epithelium . However , whether small nucleolar RNAs participate in the regulation of ISC self renewal remains unclear . Here , we identified a small nucleolar RNA ( Snora54 ) that was highly expressed in the nucleolus of ISCs . Snora54 knockout enhanced the self renewal capacity of ISCs and intestinal regeneration . Mechanistically , in a steady state , highly expressed Snora54 anchored the nucleolar protein Lyar in the nucleolus of ISCs , preventing Lyar from translocation into the nucleoplasm . Thereby , Lyar failed to recruit on the Notch2 promoter region in the nucleoplasm to promote Notch2 transcription , leading to suppression of ISC self renewal . By contrast , with deletion of Snora54 , Lyar translocated to the nucleoplasm of ISCs where it enriched on the Notch2 promoter to initiate its transcription resulting in the activation of Notch2 signaling pathway . Therefore , Snora54 negatively regulates self renewal of ISCs and gut regeneration via suppression of Notch2 signaling . FAU Zhang , Jiahang
The development of the airway epithelium in asthma is unclear . We characterized nasal airway epithelial cell ( NAEC ) developmental phenotypes from children aged 2 to 3 years in an a priori designed nested birth cohort from four mutually exclusive groups of wheezers/nonwheezers and respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) infected/uninfected in the first year of life . NAECs were differentiated , followed by single cell RNA sequencing analysis and in vitro RSV infection . Gene expression of NAECs from children with a wheeze phenotype indicated abnormal differentiation and basal cell activation of developmental pathways , plasticity in precursor differentiation , delayed onset of maturation , increased diversity of RSV receptors , and blunted antiviral immune responses to in vitro RSV infection . The most marked changes in differentiation were observed in NAECs from children with both wheeze and RSV in the first year of life . Together , this suggests that airway epithelium in children with wheeze is developmentally reprogrammed and characterized by increased barrier permeability , decreased antiviral response , and altered RSV receptor expression .

The adult mammalian heart has limited regenerative capacity due to the low proliferative ability of cardiomyocytes , whereas embryonic cardiomyocytes exhibit robust proliferative potential . Using single cell RNA sequencing of embryonic hearts , we identified prothymosin alpha ( PTMA ) as a key factor driving cardiomyocyte proliferation . Overexpression of PTMA in primary mouse and rat cardiomyocytes significantly promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation and similarly enhanced proliferation in human iPSC derived cardiomyocytes . Conditional knockout of Ptma in cardiomyocytes impaired neonatal heart regeneration . AAV9 mediated overexpression of Ptma extended the neonatal proliferative window and showed therapeutic promise for enhancing adult heart regeneration . Mechanistically , PTMA interacted with MBD3 , inhibiting its deacetylation activity within the MBD3/HDAC1 NuRD complex . This inhibition increased STAT3 acetylation , which positively regulated STAT3 phosphorylation and activation of its target genes . These findings establish PTMA as a critical regulator of heart regeneration and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target for ischemic myocardial injury . FAU Liu , Ning
Aggressive brain tumors often exhibit immunologically ' cold ' microenvironment , where the vascular barrier impedes effective immunotherapy in poorly understood ways . Tumor vasculature also plays a pivotal role in immunoregulation and antitumor immunity . Here , we show that small GTPase Rab27 controls the vascular morphogenesis and permeability for blood content and immune effectors . Thus , in Rab27a/b double knock out ( Rab27 dKO ) mice , the brain vasculature is abnormally scarce , while the blood vessels become dysmorphic and hyperpermeable in the context of brain tumors , including syngeneic glioblastoma . These defects are reflected in rearrangements of endothelial cell subpopulations with underlying diminution of venous endothelial subtype along with changes in gene and protein expression . Notably , Rab27 dKO brain endothelial cells exhibit deficient tight junctions , whereby they enable large scale extravasation of cytotoxic T cells into the tumor mass . We show that Rab27 regulated vascular T cell infiltration can be exploited to enhance adoptive T cell therapy in syngeneic brain tumors . FAU Adnani , Lata
Microbial responses to environmental changes are well studied in laboratory cultures , but in situ adaptations of plankton lipidomes remain less understood . Building upon a global lipidomic study showing temperature driven lipid unsaturation regulation in marine plankton , we expanded the analysis spatially and methodologically to investigate the in situ adaptations of marine plankton . Through weighted correlation network analysis of 3164 lipid species from 930 samples , we identified 16 structurally distinct lipid clusters co occurred across diverse oceanographic conditions . The highest lipid diversity was observed in the polar oceans , where plankton uses chain shortening for cold acclimation . Conversely , in the surface of tropical and subtropical oceans , plankton showed enrichment in non phosphorus lipids , likely responding to warm temperature , with potential implications for the elemental stoichiometry of the biological pump . In the subsurface of these regions , highly unsaturated lipids were enriched , suggesting phytoplankton adaptation to low light and contributing unsaturated fatty acids to tropical and subtropical ocean food webs .

AMBRA1 is a tumor suppressor protein that functions as a substrate receptor in the ubiquitin conjugation system and regulates the stability of D type cyclins and cell proliferation . Here , we present the cryo EM structure of cyclin D1 bound AMBRA1 DDB1 complex at 55 A resolution . The structure reveals a substrate interaction surface on the AMBRA1 WD40 domain that specifically binds to the C terminal region of D type cyclins . This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of Thr residue in the C terminal phosphodegron site of D type cyclins . The phosphodegron motif folds into a turn like conformation , followed by a 3 helix that promotes its assembly with AMBRA In addition , we show that AMBRA1 mutants , which are defective in cyclin D1 binding , lead to cyclin D1 accumulation and DNA damage . Understanding the AMBRA1 D type cyclin structure enhances the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern the cell cycle control and may lead to potential therapeutic approaches for cancers linked to abnormal cyclin D activity .

Action potentials are initiated and modulated at the axon initial segment ( AIS ) by highly clustered ion channels . Voltage gated Kv1 potassium channels underlie most outward AIS K ( + ) current . AIS Kv1 channels exist in a large protein complex including ADAM22 , Caspr2 , and LGI However , their clustering mechanisms remain unknown . Because Kv1 channels have a highly conserved PDZ binding motif , we used CRISPR based genome editing to screen 18 PDZ domain containing proteins identified in our previous AIS proximity proteome for their AIS localization . Among these , we found that the scaffolding proteins SCRIB and PSD93 are highly enriched at the AIS . Using CRISPR mediated knockout , cell surface clustering assays , and coimmunoprecipitation , we show that SCRIB and PSD93 bind to and are required for AIS Kv1 channel clustering , whereas SCRIB links the AIS Kv1 channel protein complex to the master AIS scaffolding protein AnkyrinG . These results define a hierarchy of scaffolding proteins that combine to cluster AIS Kv1 channels . FAU Zhang , Wei
Tumor hypoxia leads to radioresistance and markedly worse clinical outcomes for pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumors ( MRTs ) . Our transcriptomics and bioenergetic profiling data reveal that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is a metabolic vulnerability of MRT and can be exploited to overcome consumptive hypoxia by repurposing an FDA approved antimalarial drug , atovaquone ( AVO ) . We then establish the utility of oxygen enhanced multispectral optoacoustic tomography , a label free , ionizing radiation free imaging modality , to visualize and quantify spatiotemporal changes in tumor hypoxia in response to AVO . We show a potent but transient increase in tumor oxygenation upon AVO treatment that results in complete elimination of tumors in all tested mice when combined with 10 gray radiotherapy , a dose several times lower than the current clinic standard . Last , we use translational mathematical modeling for systematic evaluation of dosing regimens , administration timing , and therapeutic synergy in a virtual patient cohort . Together , our work establishes a framework for safe and pediatric patient friendly image guided metabolic radiosensitization of rhabdoid tumors . FAU Xia , Wenxi
PURPOSE : To test whether differences in pupil responses to melanopsin isolating spectral stimuli in glaucoma may be useful as a diagnostic biomarker . METHODS : Spectral stimuli were presented to 20 glaucoma and 15 age similar healthy control participants . Stimuli were pairs of silent substitution spectra designed to provide equal stimulation to cone photoreceptors but maximum ( ~325% ) contrast to melanopsin or equal stimulation to melanopsin but ~325% contrast to cones . Narrowband long wavelength/red ( 657 nm ) and short wavelength/blue ( 471 nm ) pulses were also presented from a dark background to 16 glaucoma and 12 control participants . Pulses lasted 3 seconds and pupil size was measured for 15 seconds . Pupil response metrics were compared by t test and relationships with visual field and OCT summary indices were assessed by Spearman ' s rank correlation . Diagnostic accuracy was measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC ) . RESULTS : Pupil constriction was more persistent after pulse offset for the melanopsin directed stimulus ( 2% mean paired difference 6s post pulse offset , p < 001 ) . All pupil parameters were similar between groups ( p = 04 90 ) for all stimuli . Correlations between pupil response parameters and visual field summary indices and circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness were weak ( rho 02 57 , all p > 05 ) . Diagnostic accuracy for all pupil parameters was poor , with AUC 95% confidence intervals overlapping 5 for all but time to maximal constriction for the cone directed stimulus . CONCLUSIONS : Pupil responses to melanopsin isolating spectra were similar between glaucoma and control participants . Pupillary responses to melanopsin isolating silent substitution spectra are unlikely to be useful as a diagnostic biomarker for glaucoma .
This study presents an innovative exploration of the American Caselaw database , encompassing more than five million legal cases spanning three centuries of American history . Using complex network analysis , we reveal the organic nature of the US Caselaw , fundamentally anchored in common law . Through analysis of citation and bibliographic coupling networks , we shed light on the system ' s internal structure , unveiling communities delineated by regional , federal jurisdiction , and clustering based on similar legal citations . Our research uncovers a remarkable allometric relationship between the activity of judges and the legal case citations , reflecting the analogy between metabolic rate and body mass correlation observed in biological organisms . Furthermore , our results show a consistent self similar characteristics of the communities and their maximum spanning trees , which also provides relevant insight into the origin of the allometric behavior . This analysis not only reveals the US Caselaw as a " living " entity but also sets a precedent in Caselaw based judicial system studies , reinforcing the notion of its dynamic , organic functionality in the realm of analyzing complex legal systems .
OBJECTIVE : To investigate the efficacy of Nintedanib in treating acute and chronic radiation induced lung injury and its mechanism of action . METHODS : A radiation induced lung injury model was established in mice using 6MV X rays at 18Gy to irradiate the lungs . The mice were randomly divided into four groups : control group , radiation therapy group , low dosage Nintedanib + radiation therapy group , and high dosage Nintedanib + radiation therapy group . The mice were euthanized on day 14 and 3 months post radiation to observe changes in acute and chronic inflammation and the expression of related proteins . RESULTS : Compared to the radiation therapy group , the low and high dosage Nintedanib groups showed varying degrees of improvement in mental state , responsiveness , food and water intake , and fur condition . During the acute inflammatory phase , HE staining revealed inflammatory changes in the lung tissues of both Nintedanib groups , but the pathology was less severe than in the radiation group , with the high dosage group showing more significant reduction . Serum levels of IL 6 , TNF alpha and TGF beta1 were significantly reduced ( P < 05 ) , suggesting that Nintedanib can decrease the expression of serum inflammatory factors . The percentage of Smad2 positive area in the low and high dosage Nintedanib groups was ( 395 +/ 90 ) % and ( 577 +/ 56 ) % , respectively , both significantly lower than the radiation group ( P < 05 ) . At 3 months post radiation , Masson ' s trichrome staining showed that the Ashcroft score in the Nintedanib groups was significantly lower than in the radiation group ( P < 05 ) . There were statistically significant differences between the low and high dosage groups in the percentage of Smad2 and alphaSMA positive areas and the levels of serum TGF beta1 ( all P < 05 ) , and both were significantly lower compared to the radiation group ( P < 05 ) . CONCLUSION : Nintedanib can improve the general condition of mice with acute and chronic radiation induced lung injury and reduce pathological damage to lung tissue . Nintedanib may exert a protective effect on mice with acute and chronic radiation induced lung injury by downregulating the TGF beta1/Smad2 signaling pathway , thereby inhibiting inflammatory and fibrotic responses .
Compelling evidence links age related brain dysfunction and neurodegenerative processes to persistent disruptions in intracellular calcium ( Ca2+ ) signaling , a central hypothesis in the Ca2+ theory of aging . Calbindin ( CB ) , a classical Ca2+ buffer , has been implicated in region specific susceptibility to aging related effects . Specifically , CB immunopositive ( CB+ ) neurons have demonstrated an age dependent decline in neuronal number across various cortical and subcortical regions . However , it remains unclear whether this decrease occur in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus ( DLG ) , a crucial relay and modulatory center for visual processing . Additionally , the potential impact of aging on the cellular volume of CB+ neurons in the DLG has not been fully elucidated , albeit an age dependent neuronal hypertrophy of this region has been reported . To address these questions , we investigated CB+ neurons in the DLG of six marmosets ( Callithrix jacchus ) , aged between 29 143 months . Using design based stereological techniques , we estimated the total number and somal volume of CB+ neurons in DLG layers . Our results revealed no signs of CB+ neuronal number loss and somal volumetric changes in aged DLG , particularly within the koniocellular layers , a stratum that primarily expresses CB and play a critical role in blue/yellow color vision . Altogether , our findings suggest a preserved neuronal number and cellular volume of the CB+ population during aging process in the marmoset DLG . Moreover , they provide a valuable basis for future investigations into the neuroprotective role of CB in visual processing during aging and open avenues for strategies designed to preserve vulnerable neuronal populations in age related neurodegenerative conditions .
High circulating parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism is proposed to be a key driver of the skeletal phenotype of chronic kidney disease mineral bone disorder ( CKD MBD ) leading to high bone turnover and cortical bone deterioration . The association between high PTH and the skeletal phenotype is typically clearly demonstrated in preclinical models of CKD ; however , clinical studies show the relationship between PTH and skeletal outcomes is not as clear . The clinical data have led to a proposed hyporesponsiveness to PTH in the CKD setting with unclear causes . In the current study , we assessed skeletally mature male C57BL/6J mice at 12 weeks and 21 weeks of adenine induced CKD ( Ad ) with the second timepoint seven weeks longer than we have previously assessed . We found that serum BUN was high in Ad mice in both groups indicating the presence of kidney disease while PTH was higher in 21 wk Ad vs . 12 wk Ad . Despite the higher PTH , bone formation rate in 21 wk Ad mice was lower than 21 wk Ad mice . Additionally , immunohistochemical assessment of the PTH receptor , PTHR1 , and RANKL , a key factor upregulated by PTH , showed a lower percentage of osteocytes positive for the proteins in 21 wk Ad vs . 12 wk Ad . Furthermore , regression analyses demonstrated a positive relationship between serum PTH and PTHR1 and RANKL at 12 weeks , but this relationship was lost by 21 weeks . Overall , these data indicate that prolonged exposure to continuously elevated PTH in adenine induced CKD mice eventually led to an altered skeletal response indicating lower responsiveness of bone , particularly osteocytes , to the chronic PTH signal . This has implications for using PTH as a surrogate marker of bone outcomes in CKD as well as pointing to the need to better understand the time based relationship between PTH and skeletal outcomes in CKD .
BACKGROUND : Early detection of pancreatic cancer is essential for improving survival rates . However , noninvasive diagnostic methods are lacking . Novel biomarkers , detectable through liquid biopsy , such as circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) , microRNAs ( miRNAs ) , protein markers , and metabolites , hold promise for early diagnosis . METHODS : A systematic search of PubMed , Embase , Web of Science , and the Cochrane Library was conducted for studies published from January 2014 to May Studies were included if they evaluated novel biomarkers for early pancreatic cancer detection , reported diagnostic performance metrics ( sensitivity , specificity ) , and had a QUADAS 2 score of >/= Data on study characteristics , patient demographics , biomarker types , and diagnostic performance were extracted following PRISMA guidelines . A bivariate random effects model was used to calculate pooled sensitivity , specificity , positive likelihood ratio ( PLR ) , negative likelihood ratio ( NLR ) , and diagnostic odds ratio ( DOR ) . The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic ( SROC ) curve assessed overall diagnostic accuracy . The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy ( sensitivity and specificity ) of novel biomarkers in detecting early stage pancreatic cancer . RESULTS : A total of 43 studies involving 19 , 326 participants were included , with 2 , 749 patients having stage I or II pancreatic cancer . The pooled sensitivities and specificities were as follows : . miRNA Biomarkers : Sensitivity 88 ( 95% CI 79 93 ) , Specificity 91 ( 95% CI 82 95 ) , DOR 68 ( 95% CI 64 24 ) , AUC Protein Biomarkers : Sensitivity 79 ( 95% CI 70 86 ) , Specificity 88 ( 95% CI 82 93 ) , DOR 74 ( 95% CI 32 76 ) , AUC Metabolite Biomarkers : Sensitivity 84 ( 95% CI 73 92 ) , Specificity 85 ( 95% CI 81 88 ) , DOR 76 ( 95% CI 38 48 ) , AUC ctDNA Biomarkers : Sensitivity 65 ( 95% CI 48 81 ) , Specificity 94 ( 95% CI 88 97 ) , DOR 73 ( 95% CI 91 55 ) , AUC Subgroup analyses showed combining biomarkers with CA19 9 improved diagnostic accuracy .

BACKGROUND : Obesity negatively affects reproduction and in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) outcomes . However , its effects on lipid metabolism during embryonic development remain unclear . We examined follicular fluid ( FF ) lipid composition and body mass index ( BMI ) related embryological outcomes in Korean women undergoing IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) . METHODS : This prospective cohort study included 68 Korean women with infertility without metabolic diseases who underwent IVF/ICSI . Patients were categorized according to the 2022 guidelines of the Korean Society for the Study of Obesity as follows : Group A ( obese , BMI >/= 25 kg/m2 , n = 28 ) and Group B ( non obese , BMI < 25 kg/m2 , n = 40 ) . Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC MS ) was used to analyze lipids in the FF . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) and correlation analyses were performed . Embryological outcomes according to the BMI were compared using the QUADE nonparametric analysis of covariance adjusted for age and anti Mullerian hormone . RESULTS : LC MS identified 159 of the 230 lipids in the FF samples . Diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , triacylglycerol ( TAG ) , and acylcarnitine ( AC ) levels were significantly higher in the obese group ; whereas monoacylglycerol ( MAG ) and plasmenyl phosphatidylcholine levels were lower . PCA explained 9% of the variance between the groups . Significant inter group differences were found in the DAG ( adjusted p < 05 ) and AC 16 : 1 ( adjusted p = 0139 ) levels . BMI and TAG , DAG , and AC levels ( adjusted p < 05 ) were positively correlated . Obese group had fewer fertilized oocytes ( 07 +/ 16 vs . 65 +/ 61 , p = 043 ) , cleavage stage embryos ( 86 +/ 26 vs . 63 +/ 61 , p = 016 ) , and morula stage embryos ( 00 +/ 51 vs . 05 +/ 14 , p = 024 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Obesity alters FF lipid composition in women with infertility undergoing IVF/ICSI , potentially affecting early embryonic development . This study improves our understanding of its effects on the ovarian microenvironment and offers insights into targeted IVF interventions .
T cell therapy efficacy can be compromised if cytokine induced Janus kinase ( JAK ) signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) signaling is dysregulated or insufficient to sustain functionality . Here , we demonstrate that LCK kinase activity can be recruited to noncanonical protein substrates to directly activate targeted STAT proteins in T cells . STAT activation was accomplished by engineering the herpesvirus saimiri tyrosine kinase interacting protein ( TIP ) to provide a platform for the enforced recruitment of LCK to STAT proteins . We determined that a minimal region of TIP that binds to LCK could be combined with STAT binding sites derived from endogenous cytokine receptors . These constructs activated targeted STAT proteins in a cytokine independent manner . We identified a STAT5 activator that sustained CD8+ T cell survival and cytotoxic function ex vivo in the absence of interleukin Tumor outgrowth was reduced in vivo because of enhanced T cell persistence and functionality . Single cell transcriptomics revealed that the STAT5 activator prevented the expression of genes associated with an exhausted T cell fate . Our findings demonstrate that signaling pathways can be rewired in T cells to sustain their function in solid tumors . FAU Zheng , Yating
The immune response exhibits strong circadian rhythmicity , with enhanced bacterial clearance often synchronized with an organism ' s active phase . Despite providing the bulk of cellular antibacterial defense , the neutrophil clockwork is poorly understood . Here , we used larval zebrafish to explore the role of clock genes in neutrophils during infection . Per2 was required in neutrophils for reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production and bacterial killing by enhancing infection responsive expression of high mobility group box 1a ( hmgb1a ) . The Cry binding domain of Per2 was required for regulation of neutrophil bactericidal activity , and neutrophils lacking Cry1a had elevated bactericidal activity and infection responsive hmgb1a expression . A conserved cis regulatory element with BMAL1 and nuclear factor kappaB binding motifs gated infection responsive hmgb1a expression to the light phase . Mutagenesis of the BMAL1 motif in neutrophils blunted the priming effect of light on bactericidal activity and hmgb1a expression . These findings identify a light responsive cell intrinsic timer that controls time of day variations in antibacterial activity . FAU Du , Lucia Yi
AIMS : To investigate whether optimal glycemic control is associated with all cause mortality , cardiovascular disease mortality , diabetes related mortality , cancer related mortality , and complications among individuals with early onset and late onset T2D . METHODS : We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the U . S . National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey ( NHANES ) 1999 Optimal glycemic control was defined as HbA1c<7% , and poor glycemic control as HbA1c>/=9% . Mortality and underlying causes of death were ascertained by linkage to national death records through 31 December Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age , sex , race , education , body mass index ( BMI ) , hypertension , smoking status , alcohol consumption , and physical activity were used to estimate hazard ratios ( HRs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) for associations between HbA1c levels and mortality . Logistic regression models with the same covariates were employed to calculate odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95% CIs for complications , supplemented by sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the findings . RESULTS : Among the 5946 participants with diabetes , 8% were classified as having early onset T2D ( aged < 40 years ) , 7% as having late onset T2D ( aged </= 60 years ) , and 5% had average onset T2D . For individuals with early onset T2D , the poorly controlled group ( HbA1c>/=9% ) had HRs of 00 ( 95% CI , 30 09 ; P = 002 ) for all cause mortality and 04 ( 95% CI , 57 32 ; P = 001 ) for diabetes related mortality versus the optimal controlled group ( HbA1c<7% ) . The poorly controlled group had odds of 80 ( 95% CI , 10 94 ; P = 022 ) for retinopathy and 54 ( 95% CI , 65 92 ; P < 001 ) for chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) versus the optimal controlled group . For individuals with late onset T2D , the HRs were 87 ( HR 87 ; 95% CI , 54 40 ; P = 561 ) for all cause mortality and 24 ( 95% CI , 33 67 ; P = 751 ) for diabetes related mortality compared with the optimal controlled group . The poorly controlled group had odds of 12 ( 95% CI , 32 41 ; P = 002 ) for retinopathy and 30 ( 95% CI , 45 63 ; P = 001 ) for CKD versus the optimal controlled group . CONCLUSION : Optimal glycemic control was associated with a reduced risk of all cause mortality , diabetes related mortality , retinopathy , and CKD in individuals with early onset T2D ; however , in individuals with late onset T2D , this correlation was limited to lower risks of retinopathy and CKD . These findings suggest that glycemic control strategies should be tailored on the basis of the age of diabetes onset .
Zika virus ( ZIKV ) infection can lead to a variety of clinical outcomes , including severe congenital abnormalities . The phosphatidylserine receptors AXL and TIM 1 are recognized as critical entry factors for ZIKV in vitro . However , it remains unclear whether and how ZIKV regulates these receptors during infection . In this study , we investigated AXL and TIM 1 expression in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells , glioblastoma U87 cells , and embryonic stem cell derived trophoblasts following ZIKV infection . We found that both the Asian strain FSS13025 and the African strain MR766 of ZIKV downregulate AXL , with a milder effect on TIM We identified several ZIKV proteins , notably envelope ( E ) , NS2A , NS3 , and NS4B , that contribute to this downregulation . Notably , treatment with lysosomal inhibitor NHCl or the autophagy inhibitor 3 methyladenine mitigated the AXL/TIM 1 downregulation , indicating autophagy ' s involvement in the process . Importantly , this downregulation facilitates sustained viral replication and promotes viral spread by preventing superinfection and limiting cell death , which is also associated with impaired innate immune signaling . Our findings uncover a mechanism by which ZIKV downregulates entry factors to enhance prolonged viral replication and spread . FAU Yu , Jingyou
NOD like receptors ( NLRs ) are a highly conserved family of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors that drive innate immune responses against pathogens , pathogen associated molecular patterns , damage associated molecular patterns , and homeostatic disruptions . Within the NLR family , NLRP12 was recently identified as a key regulator of PANoptosis , which is an innate immune , lytic cell death pathway initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes . While NLRP12 activation is critical for maintaining homeostasis , aberrant activation has been implicated in a broad range of disorders , including cancers and metabolic , infectious , autoinflammatory , and hemolytic diseases . However , the molecular mechanisms of NLRP12 activation remain poorly understood . Here , we identified hematopoietic cell kinase ( HCK ) as a regulator of NLRP12 mediated PANoptosis . HCK expression was significantly upregulated in response to NLRP12 PANoptosome triggers . Moreover , Hck knockdown inhibited NLRP12 mediated PANoptosis . Computational analyses identified residues in the putative interaction interface between NLRP12 and HCK , suggesting that HCK likely binds NLRP12 in the region between its NACHT domain and pyrin domain ( PYD ) ; removal of the NLRP12 PYD abrogated this interaction in vitro . Overall , our work identifies HCK as a regulator of NLRP12 mediated PANoptosis , suggesting that it may serve as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating inflammation and pathology .

Malaria and typhoid fever remain major health issues in developing countries like Cameroon , with frequent co infections . The potential liver damage caused by their respective causative pathogens is overlooked in health management , posing a significant risk of severe liver injury and worsening patient conditions . Accordingly , this study investigated the risk factors associated with liver damage in febrile patients with malaria , typhoid fever , or co infection at the Obili District Medical Center and Mvog Betsi Dominican Hospital Center , Yaounde , Cameroon . Over 8 months , 350 febrile patients were evaluated for their adherence to preventive measures concerning malaria and typhoid fever using a structured questionnaire . Blood samples were analyzed for Plasmodium species and Salmonella antibodies and liver enzyme levels were measured . Liver damage was assessed using the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method . Risk factors for infections and liver damage were identified using Fisher ' s Exact and Chi Square tests , with significance set at P < Among participants tested , 129 ( 86% ) and 106 ( 29% ) were positive for malaria and typhoid , respectively , while 56 ( 00% ) were co infected . Men ( 2% and 3% ) were more affected than women ( 6% and 7% ) for both malaria and typhoid , respectively . Participants aged between 20 and 40 years were the most affected by malaria ( 4% ) and typhoid fever ( 4% ) . The non use of mosquito nets , presence of standing water , bushes , and garbage dumps near residences were significant risk factors ( Relative risk : RR > 1 ; P < 0001 ) for contracting malaria or typhoid fever . The co infection status ( Chi 2 = 30 ; P < 0001 ) , parasite density ( Chi 2 = 8 ; P = 0074 ) , and delay before consulting ( Chi 2 = 23 ; P = 0013 ) were significant risk factors for the occurrence of liver injuries . Our findings demonstrated that the alteration of liver enzyme activity , reflecting liver damage among patients with malaria , typhoid , or malaria typhoid co infection , is a reality and should be considered during the patient treatment .
Sepsis , a dysregulated host response to infection , severely affects calf health . To date , sepsis diagnosis relies on clinical examination and positive blood culture . Differently , in humans 16S rRNA gene analysis is a valuable adjunct to blood culture as it allows for broader assessment of bacterial DNA in whole blood and its fractions . However , its efficacy in cattle remains unknown . Therefore , this study characterized and compared the bacterial DNA detected in whole blood and its fractions between healthy calves and those showing clinical signs of sepsis . The study sample was 18 Piedmontese calves classified according to their clinical status as suspected septic ( S , 8/18 ) or healthy ( H , 10/18 ) . Aseptic blood samples were collected into EDTA tubes for 16S rRNA gene analysis of whole blood ( WB ) , plasma ( PL ) , buffy coat ( BC ) , and red blood cells ( RBC ) . Aseptic samples were additionally taken only from the S calves for blood culture . Clinical and microbiological parameters were compared between the two groups and between the blood fractions within each group . The S calves were diagnosed with pneumonia ( 3/8 , 5% ) , enteritis ( 3/8 , 5% ) , and omphalitis ( 2/8 , 25% ) . Microbiome analysis revealed significant intra group differences in alpha and beta diversity indices between PL and the other blood fractions for both groups . Comparison between the S and the H calves showed differences in beta diversity indices for PL and WB . DNA of known pathogens ( e . g . , Escherichia coli ) and species not commonly associated with sepsis ( e . g . , Cutibacterium acnes ) were more abundant in the S calves . Moreover , in S calves , 16S rRNA gene sequencing detected E . coli DNA more often ( 8/8 , 100% ) than blood culture ( 2/8 , 25% ) . While the DNA of several bacteria can be detected in calves showing clinical signs of sepsis , further studies are needed to clarify its origin , role , and distribution in blood fractions .
Elevated beta glucuronidase activity is associated with the production of toxic metabolites that contribute to tumor development and other diseases . Inhibiting this enzyme may offer therapeutic potential , including the prevention of colonic carcinogenesis . This study investigates the antidiabetic potential of metabolites derived from Fernandoa adenophylla , using beta glucuronidase as a model enzyme linked to hyperglycemia . Both Escherichia coli and human isoforms of beta glucuronidase were evaluated . Among the tested compounds , AA and DD exhibited the most significant inhibitory activity against the E . coli isoenzyme , with inhibition rates of 2% ( IC = 3 microM ) and 6% ( IC = 2 microM ) , respectively . Against the human isoenzyme , compounds DD and CC showed the highest inhibition , with 6% ( IC = 2 microM ) and 4% ( IC = 9 microM ) , respectively . These findings were further supported by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations . So , these results highlight the potential of F . adenophylla metabolites as promising candidates for developing novel therapeutic agents targeting beta glucuronidase .
BACKGROUND : This study examined the ratio of erythrocyte distribution width ( RDW ) to albumin concentration ( RAR ) and all cause , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , and cancer mortality in the hypertension population , focusing on the role of inflammatory markers as mediators . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Data from NHANES ( 1999 2018 ) were analyzed , linking National Death Index ( NDI ) records to mortality outcomes through December 31 , A weighted sampling design categorized participants into three RAR groups . Cox regression models adjusted for demographic and clinical variables assessed the association between RAR and mortality outcomes . Mediation analyses explored the mediating role of the systemic Inflammatory response index ( SIRI ) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) . RESULTS : Among 26 , 935 participants with a median follow up of 102 months and 6 , 007 deaths , elevated RAR was associated with increased risks of all cause mortality ( HR = 83 , 95% CI : 76 90 ) , cardiovascular disease mortality ( HR = 81 , 95% CI : 68 95 ) , and cancer mortality ( HR = 70 , 95% CI : 55 86 ) . Segmented regression showed a nonlinear relationship between RAR and all cause mortality , cardiovascular mortality , and cancer mortality , and the threshold effect results showed a fold value of 10 , with a greater HR when RAR < Mediation analysis revealed that SIRI and NLR mediated the relationship between RAR and all cause mortality by 12% and 00% , respectively . CONCLUSION : In hypertensive populations , higher RAR values are associated with increased all cause mortality , cardiovascular mortality , and cancer mortality . Inflammation partially mediates the relationship between RAR and all cause mortality .
The circulatory system plays a significant role in the adaptation of the human body to varying environmental conditions and stress factors , such as cold water immersion . The aim of the study was to determine whether a single immersion in cold water below 4 degrees C , at air temperature of 15 degrees C constitutes a health risk in young healthy men . For this purpose , the following parameters were determined in the blood samples collected in 13 young males before and after cold water immersion : electrolytes , renal profile , liver profile , lipid profile , glucose , testosterone , thyroid stimulating hormone , cortisol . After the immersion , a statistically significant decrease was found for Cl ( p </= 027 ) , mean values of renal profile indicators : urea ( p = 0019 ) , creatinine ( p = 0007 ) , and uric acid ( p = 0293 ) , as well as testosterone ( p = 000037 ) . In turn , higher values of estimated glomerular filtration rate ( p = 0425 ) , total bilirubin ( p = 0033 ) , aspartate transaminase ( p = 0023 ) , alanine transaminase ( p = 0053 ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( p = 0336 ) , creatine kinase ( p = 0117 ) , CK MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase ( p = 0028 ) , and high density lipoprotein ( p = 0270 ) were measured after cold water immersion . No significant changes in other biochemical parameters were observed . Single cold water immersion thus resulted in significant changes of blood parameters within non pathological limits .
Aerobic exercise is more recommended than anaerobic exercise for individuals with cardiopulmonary dysfunction to avoid cardiopulmonary stress . However , their oxygen carrying capacity is already reduced , making it difficult to exercise enough . Therefore , we aimed to investigate whether mild hyperbaric hyperoxia enhances aerobic capacity and decreases cardiopulmonary stress during exercise with a particular focus on the ventilatory threshold ( VT ) . Nineteen healthy men ( age 9 +/ 8 years ) performed ramp loading tests on a cycle ergometer under the three oxygen conditions : hypobaric hypoxia ( HYPO ; 7 ATA , 7% O2 ) , normobaric normoxia ( NOR ; 0 ATA , 21% O2 ) , and mild hyperbaric hyperoxia ( HYPER ; 3 ATA , 35% O2 ) . Cardiopulmonary data were recorded using a gas exchange analyzer . VT was assessed based on minute ventilation ( VE ) using the V slope method and the work rate on VT ( WVT ) was determined . Although the maximal values of VE did not differ among the oxygen conditions , WVT in the HYPER condition was significantly higher compared to others ( HYPO ; 125 +/ 21 , NOR ; 148 +/ 24 , HYPER ; 168 +/ 32 [W] , each p < 01 ) . Systolic blood pressure and double product on VT in the HYPER condition were significantly reduced compared to others ( HYPO ; 172 +/ 21 , 23096 +/ 4354 , NOR ; 173 +/ 15 , 23377 +/ 3109 , HYPER ; 155 +/ 18 , 21255 +/ 3340 [mmHg , beats . min mmHg] , each p < 05 ) . Although further clinical research targeting other populations is needed to apply mild hyperbaric hyperoxia in clinical practice , due to its positive effects on WVT and cardiopulmonary stress , the HYPER oxygen condition may potentially be used to enhance aerobic capacity and make individuals with cardiopulmonary dysfunction exercise safely .
Air pollution is a serious environmental threat to public health ; however , the molecular basis underlying its detrimental effects on respiratory fitness remains poorly understood . Here , we show that exposure to particulate matter </=5 microm ( PM5 ) , a significant fraction of air pollutants , induces the generation of reactive aldehyde species in the airway . We identified aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 ( ALDH1A1 ) , which is selectively expressed in airway epithelium , as an enzyme responsible for detoxifying these reactive aldehyde species . Loss of ALDH1A1 function results in the accumulation of aldehyde adducts in the airway , which selectively impairs mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) , a critical defense mechanism against respiratory pathogens . Thus , ALDH1A1 deficient mice pre exposed to PM5 exhibited increased susceptibility to pneumonia . Conversely , pharmacological enhancement of ALDH1A1 activity promoted the restoration of MCC function . These findings elucidate the critical role of aldehyde metabolism in protecting against PM5 exposure , offering a potential target to mitigate the negative health consequences of air pollution .

Camellia oleifera , a vital woody oil crop in China , suffers substantial yield losses due to frequent physiological fruit abscission during cultivation . Ethylene signaling , mediated by Ethylene Insensitive3/Ethylene Insensitive 3 like ( EIN3/EIL ) transcription factors encoded by a multigene family , plays a pivotal role in plant organ abscission . However , the EIN3/EIL family remains understudied in C . oleifera . Here , genome wide analysis identified four CoEIL genes encoding proteins with conserved EIN3 domains . Phylogenetic classification grouped these proteins into Group A and Group B , revealing evolutionary proximity between C . oleifera and tea ( Camellia sinensis ) . Cis acting regulatory element analysis implicated CoEIL genes in hormone responsiveness and stress adaptation . Quantitative real time PCR analysis was performed to investigate the expression patterns of these CoEIL genes in the fruit abscission zone following ethephon and brassinolide treatments . This study elucidates the genetic architecture and functional divergence of CoEIL genes , laying the foundation for exploring molecular mechanisms of abscission in C . oleifera .
BACKGROUND : Prior studies have linked the aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase ratio ( AAR ) with negative health outcomes in the elderly and specific populations . However , the impact of AAR on the prognosis of the entire population in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) remains unclear . This study aimed to determine the correlation between AAR and the mortality among adult ICU patients . METHOD : Patient data were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV ( MIMIC IV ) database and stratified into quartiles by AAR . Survival analysis using the Kaplan Meier curves was conducted to compare survival across quartiles . The primary outcome was 28 day mortality , with secondary outcomes including 60 day , 90 day , and 365 day mortality , along with ICU free , ventilator free , and vasopressor free days within the first 28 days . The association between AAR and mortality was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis complemented by a restricted cubic spline . Furthermore , the eICU Collaborative Research Database ( eICU CRD ) was used as an external validation cohort for sensitivity analysis . RESULT : The study included 20 , 225 patients with a mean age of 7 +/ 5 years . Kaplan Meier analysis indicated a higher risk of 28 day mortality for patients with higher AAR ( log rank P < 001 ) . After adjusting for confounders , the AAR was significantly related to 28 day mortality ( HR = 04 , 95% CI : 03 06 , P < 001 ) and other mortality benchmarks , exhibiting an inverted L shaped relationship . The inflection point of the AAR for 28 day mortality was Below this threshold , each unit increase in the AAR was associated with a 19% rise in the risk of 28 day mortality ( HR = 19 , 95% CI : 11 27 , P < 001 ) , with a plateau observed above this threshold . Subgroup and sensitivity analyses further confirmed the robustness and generalizability of the study . CONCLUSION : AAR demonstrated a significant association with 28 day , 60 day , 90 day , and 365 day mortality , characterized by an inverted L shaped pattern .
Outer hair cell bundles are sensory organelles required for normal hearing in mammals . These bundles convert sound induced forces into receptor currents . This conversion depends on the resting receptor current of each bundle , which increases when extracellular calcium is decreased to the physiological level . How extracellular calcium regulates the bundle ' s resting state is not well understood . We propose a mechanism explaining how extracellular calcium can regulate the outer hair cell bundle ' s resting state . Each bundle comprises filamentous stereocilia linked by gating springs that are attached to ion channels . Sound induced forces deflect stereocilia , increasing and decreasing gating spring tensions , opening and closing the ion channels , resulting in an oscillating receptor current . We hypothesize that decreasing extracellular calcium , decreases the heights of the shorter stereocilia , increasing resting gating spring tensions , which increases the resting receptor current and decreases the bundle ' s resting deflection . To determine the plausibility of this mechanism , we build a mathematical model of an outer hair cell bundle and calibrate the model using seven independent experimental observations . The calibrated model shows that the mechanism is quantitatively plausible and predicts that a decrease of only 10 nm in the heights of the shorter stereocilia when extracellular calcium is lowered is sufficient to explain the observed increase in the resting receptor current . The model predicts the values of nine parameters and makes several additional predictions .
Several T cell immune checkpoint blockade therapies have shown initial successes in multiple cancers . However , significant issues remain , including tumor relapse , severe toxicities , and a lack of efficacy in most patients . SIRPalpha , commonly known as the " do not eat me signal " , is a monocyte checkpoint cell surface protein . Agents that block the interaction of CD47 with SIRPalpha have recently shown clinical success in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy to potentiate macrophage phagocytosis of tumors . However , significant toxicities and logistical issues are associated with CD47 targeted agents due to the expression of CD47 on all human cells . In contrast , SIRPalpha has expression limited to myelomonocytic cells , meaning highly specific SIRPalpha blocking agents might reduce these toxicities and avoid the target antigen sink . Herein , we generated a high affinity and highly specific SIRPalpha targeting monoclonal antibody , F05 , that has enhanced SIRPalpha binding and reduced SIRPbeta and SIRPgamma binding capacity when compared to other available SIRPalpha antibodies . Furthermore , we show F05 reprograms immunosuppressive macrophages toward a phagocytic profile in vitro . F05 demonstrated efficacy in solid tumor animal models , providing a rationale for further development of the antibody .
The human central nervous system simultaneously has the most highly unsaturated fatty acids ( HUFAs ) and the highest metabolic rate among body tissue . Up to 1% of consumed O is converted to reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) that cause unregulated damage to HUFA rich membrane phospholipids ( PLs ) . Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) is the brain ' s most unsaturated and abundant HUFA . Reinforcing the ROS labile bis allylic positions with deuterium ( D DHA ) protects against oxidative damage in vitro and in vivo . We developed an LC MS/MS method to detect ambient levels of nascent oxidation products of DHA and D DHA containing PLs in vivo in rat brain lipid extracts . Multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM ) triggered mass spectra confirmed D DHA incorporation in D DHA fed rat brain PLs . DHA PL nascent oxidation products add 2 O , consistent with known peroxidation reactions . In contrast , D DHA oxidation is primarily detected as a single O addition , consistent with epoxidation . D DHA PL showed 20% 30% lower overall oxidation compared to DHA PL . Our data are consistent with a mechanism of action whereby D DHA blocks excess lipid peroxidation , leading to lower overall membrane damage . D DHA is a unique therapeutic approach against neurodegenerative diseases where ROS driven oxidation is implicated . FAU Garza , Secilia
In recent years , cutting edge technologies have been increasingly integrated into sports to assess physical and cognitive capacities . Virtual Reality ( VR ) technology has emerged as a powerful tool , offering an immersive and controlled scenario for examining cognitive functions . In light of the growing adoption of VR systems , this study aimed to investigate the differences in visual attention and response time ( RT ) between athletes and non athletes utilizing a VR system and evaluate the discriminatory power of VR assessments towards the two groups . Sixty one participants ( Age : 22 +/ 8years ; athletes = 33 , non athletes = 28 ) underwent two visual attention evaluations through the Multiple Object Tracking ( MOT ) paradigm and three RT evaluations , all within a fully immersive VR environment . The visual attention assessments included the " MOT Assessment " ( MOT ) , which did not have a primary target to select , and the " MOT , Primary Target Onset " ( MOT PT ) , which required selecting a primary target . The three RT evaluations included Continuous RT ( RT C ) , RT with Inter Time between stimuli ( RT I ) , and Go No Go RT ( RT GNG ) . In all RT assessments , participants aimed to touch the target that turned green in the shortest time as possible . In the RT GNG test , participants responded to green targets by touching them with the hand controllers and refrained from touching red targets . No differences were found between athletes and non athletes in visual attention tasks . However , athletes outperformed non athletes in RT assessments ( RT C : 8 +/ 9ms vs . 1 +/ 6ms ; p < RT I : 1 +/ 9ms vs . 2 +/ 6ms ; p < RT GNG : 9 +/ 8ms vs . 6 +/ 8ms ; p < 001 ) . ROC curve analysis demonstrated moderate accuracy in differentiating athletes from non athletes in RT assessments ( RT C : AUC = 75 , p < 001 ; RT I : AUC = 75 , p < 001 ; RT GNG : AUC = 80 , p < 001 ) . These findings underscore the significant role of RT in distinguishing athletes from non athletes and highlight the discriminative potential of VR systems as valuable tools in sports evaluation . Including RT assessments into traditional training regimens could offer new insights for evaluating athletic performance .
Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome ( IC/BPS ) plagues patients and clinicians with its unclear etiology and pathogenesis , and ineffective treatments . Destruction of epithelial tissue and proliferation of interstitial tissue are typical pathological features of IC/BPS , in which epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) may play an important role . Both the increased urination frequency observed in mice with acute cystitis induced by cyclophosphamide ( CYP ) and the disruption of the anti leakage barrier in urothelial cells induced by LPS are associated with the occurrence of EMT . The expression of heparanase 1 ( HPSE ) and syndecan 2 ( SDC 2 ) is up regulated in the bladder mucosa of patients with IC , and both of them can promote the development of EMT . Improvement of lower urinary tract symptoms and restoration of the uroepithelial cell anti leakage barrier in mice with CYP induced cystitis after treatment with the HPSE inhibitor OGT2115 and inhibited the development of EMT . We then verified that HPSE binds to SDC 2 and that SDC 2 is a key intermediate protein in the pro EMT role of HPSE , and that EMT was inhibited by knockdown of SDC SDC 2 exerts its biological function by inhibiting the ubiquitinated degradation of TGF betaR Here we identified a novel mechanism by which the HPSE/ SDC 2 axis promotes EMT development and thus causes epithelial dysfunction and altered voiding behavior , providing a new direction for the treatment of IC/BPS .
BACKGROUND : The production of VLDL is one of the primary mechanisms through which liver cells regulate intracellular lipid homeostasis . We hypothesize that the disease characteristics of metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease ( MASLD ) differentially impact VLDL lipid composition . This study comprehensively examines the relationship between VLDL lipidome and MASLD histology and disease associated genetics , aiming to define MASLD related VLDL changes . METHODS : We performed untargeted lipidomics on serum VLDL particles in a cohort of biopsy proven MASLD patients to examine the relationship between VLDL lipidome and MASLD disease features as well as MASLD related genetic variants . RESULTS : Among 1514 detected lipid species in VLDL , triglyceride ( TG ) , phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , and ceramide ( Cer ) were the top classes . Moderate to severe hepatic steatosis was associated an increase in VLDL TG , especially those with palmitic acid ( C16 : 0 ) . A unified acyl chain distribution analysis revealed that steatosis was associated with increases in TGs with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acyl chains , but decreases in polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains , a pattern that was not mirrored in acyl chains from VLDL PC or VLDL Cer . Lobular inflammation was associated with reductions in lipids with polyunsaturated acyl chains , particularly docosahexaenoic acid ( C22 : 6 ) . Meanwhile , patients with advanced liver fibrosis ( stages 3 4 ) had reductions in VLDL TGs with both saturated and polyunsaturated acyl chains and overall enrichment in Cer species . Furthermore , MASLD associated genetic variants in PNPLA3 , TM6SF2 , GPAM , HSD17B13 , and MTARC1 demonstrated distinct VLDL lipidomic signatures in keeping with their biology in lipoprotein metabolism . CONCLUSIONS : Hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis in MASLD are associated with distinct VLDL lipidomic signatures , respectively . This relationship is further modified by MASLD genetics , suggesting a differential impact of pathogenic features on hepatocellular lipid homeostasis .
Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease ( MASLD ) is intrinsically linked with widespread metabolic perturbations , including within skeletal muscle . Indeed , MASLD is associated with a range of skeletal muscle abnormalities , including insulin resistance , myosteatosis , and sarcopenia , which all converge on the liver to drive disease progression and adverse patient outcomes . This review explores the mechanistic links between skeletal muscle and MASLD , including the role of abnormal glycemic control , systemic inflammation , and disordered myokine signaling . In turn , we discuss how intrinsic liver pathology can feed back to further exacerbate poor skeletal muscle health . Given the central importance of skeletal muscle in MASLD pathogenesis , it offers clinicians an opportunity to intervene for therapeutic benefit . We , therefore , summarize the role of nutrition and physical activity on skeletal muscle mass , quality , and metabolic function and discuss the knock on effect this has on the liver . An awareness of these treatment strategies is particularly important in the era of effective pharmacological and surgical weight loss interventions , which can be associated with the development of sarcopenia . Finally , we highlight a number of promising drug agents in the clinical trial pipeline that specifically target skeletal muscle in an attempt to improve metabolic and physical functioning .
BACKGROUND : Wilson disease ( WD ) is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in excessive hepatic copper , causing hepatic steatosis , inflammation , fibrosis , cirrhosis , and liver failure . Previous studies have revealed dysregulation of many farnesoid X receptor ( FXR ) metabolic target genes in WD , including the bile salt exporter pump , the major determinant of bile flow . METHODS : We tested the hypothesis that the FXR cistrome is decreased in Atp7b / mice in accord with dysregulated bile acid homeostasis . RESULTS : FXR binding within Atp7b / mouse livers displayed surprising complexity : FXR binding was increased in distal intergenic regions but decreased in promoter regions in Atp7b / versus wild type mice . Decreased FXR occupancy in Atp7b / versus wild type mice was observed in hepatocyte metabolic and bile acid homeostasis pathways , while enrichment of FXR binding was observed in pathways associated with cellular damage outside of hepatocytes . Indeed , disparate FXR occupancy was identified in parenchymal and non parenchymal marker genes in a manner that suggests decreased FXR activity in parenchymal cells , as expected , and increased FXR activity in non parenchymal cells . Consistent with altered FXR function , serum and liver bile acid concentrations were higher in Atp7b / mice than in wild type mice . Comparison of bile acid profiles in the serum of WD patients with " liver , " " neurological , " or " mixed " disease versus healthy controls also revealed increases in specific bile acids in WD liver versus healthy controls . CONCLUSIONS : We identified novel FXR occupancy across the genome that varied in parenchymal and non parenchymal cells , demonstrating complex FXR regulation of metabolic and hepatocellular stress pathways in Atp7b / mice . Dynamic changes in FXR activity support our novel finding of altered bile acid metabolism in Atp7b / mice and WD patients .
BACKGROUND : Surveillance for HCC remains important after hepatitis C cure . Improved sensitivity of screening with alpha fetoprotein ( AFP ) by using a parametric empirical Bayes ( PEB ) algorithm , which incorporates an individual patient ' s longitudinal AFP measurements , was previously demonstrated in a retrospective analysis of clinical trial data prior to widespread hepatitis C cure . METHODS : We analyzed de identified data extracted from the medical records of participants in the Alaska Hepatitis C Study , which aims to enroll all Alaska Native persons living in Alaska with a history of hepatitis C . ﻿We compared the performance characteristics of AFP as a screening test using the PEB method versus a fixed cutoff ( FC ) method in an observational setting , separately for HCC surveillance in active and cured hepatitis C . RESULTS : The PEB and FC methods were applied to AFP levels from participants with F3/F4 fibrosis who had active hepatitis C ( 173 no HCC , 14 HCC ) or after they achieved hepatitis C cure ( 162 no HCC , 12 HCC ) . Compared to a fixed 20 ng/mL cutoff , demonstrating 2% specificity in active hepatitis C , PEB increased sensitivity from 3% to 4% . After cure , a fixed 2 ng/mL cutoff demonstrated 2% specificity , and PEB increased sensitivity from 3% to 7% . CONCLUSIONS : The PEB algorithm can increase sensitivity and lead to earlier detection of HCC among patients with F3/F4 fibrosis , both in active and even more so in cured hepatitis C . Lower AFP levels after cure indicate that for either PEB or FC methods , screening parameters , such as cutoffs for a target specificity , should be specified separately by hepatitis C treatment status for HCC surveillance .
BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) is a globally rare , increasingly incident cancer . Metabolic reprogramming is common in cancer cells , and altered lipid homeostasis favors tumor development and progression . Previous studies have described lipid deregulation in HCC cells , while in CCA , the lipidome profile is still poorly characterized . METHODS : We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to examine the lipid level profile of intrahepatic CCA ( iCCA ) and non tumor surrounding tissue from patients , as well as in patients ' and healthy controls ' sera . RESULTS : All lipid classes were upregulated in tumor specimens and iCCA derived sera . Newly synthesized fatty acids ( FAs ) accumulated in iCCA and were only marginally directed to mitochondrial beta oxidation and scarcely folded in lipid droplets as neutral species . Metabolic flux assay showed that FAs were instead redirected toward plasma membrane formation and remodeling , being incorporated into phospholipids and sphingomyelin . A distinct lipid droplet and macrophage distribution was revealed by immunohistochemistry and Imaging Mass Cytometry . Lipid droplets were fewer in iCCA than in normal tissue and present mainly in the intratumoral fibrous septa and in M2 macrophages . Monocytes modified their lipid content and phenotype in the presence of iCCA cells , and the same effect could be recapitulated by FA supplementation . CONCLUSIONS : Our results reveal a profound alteration in the lipid content of iCCA tissues and demonstrate that FA accumulation prompts iCCA aggressiveness by supporting membrane biogenesis , generating bioactive lipids that boost proliferation , and by modifying macrophage phenotype .
Long regarded as an accessory sense , olfaction is now emerging as a metabolic architect an active agent in energy homeostasis , appetite regulation , and systemic physiology . This review explores the converging lines of evidence positioning the olfactory system not as a passive enhancer of flavor but as a dynamic mediator between environment , behavior , and internal metabolic state . Food odors engage specific olfactory receptors ( OR ( s ) ) , which are embedded in neural circuits that project to hypothalamic , limbic , and reward regions . These circuits modulate insulin release , lipid metabolism , thermogenesis , and feeding behavior often before a single bite is taken . This sensory metabolic dialogue is continuously tuned by hormonal signals ( e . g . , leptin , ghrelin , insulin ) and deeply shaped by genetic variation across the ~400 human OR genes , where individual differences in perception carry metabolic consequences . Yet this ancient sensory system now operates in a radically altered chemical landscape . Synthetic volatiles , industrial food aromas , and urban pollutants desensitize olfactory pathways , potentially contributing to overeating and metabolic disease . In parallel , a new therapeutic frontier is emerging : targeted modulation of olfactory pathways via intranasal hormones , neuromodulation , sensory retraining , and personalized interventions informed by OR genotypes offers a compelling strategy for precision metabolic care . Revisiting Sydney Whiting ' s 1853 satire , in which " Smell " was cast as a meddling underling at the digestive gates , we now find this once overlooked sentinel wielding remarkable authority . The nose , it turns out , knows and may yet hold the key to rebalancing metabolism in a world that smells very different from the one we evolved to navigate . FAU Manoel , Diogo
As sessile organisms , plants are constantly exposed to various abiotic and biotic factors in their environment . Among the biotic factors , beneficial microorganisms , pathogens , and insects cause metabolic changes that affect growth and productivity . In response to these interactions and stress conditions , plants have developed sophisticated metabolic plasticity , adjusting their primary and secondary metabolic pathways . Secondary metabolites are specialized compounds that serve various ecological functions , such as defense against herbivores and pathogens , allelopathy , interaction with beneficial microorganisms , and attraction of pollinators and seed dispersers . These metabolites also act as signaling molecules in plant microbe interactions , regulating the relationship between plants and microbes . Recent genetic and chemical research has revealed that secondary metabolites have multiple functions , acting as powerful regulators of both plant growth and defense beyond their roles in primary metabolism . This review explored the microbiome ' s complexity and emerging trends in understanding how microbiome composition and/or synthetic microbial community ( SynCom ) influence microbial and plant metabolic activities . Addressing the correlation between the varieties of microorganisms or SynCom and their metabolic profiles is crucial for elucidating the biological mechanisms that induce alterations in microbial communities and their metabolic functions within the rhizosphere and plant microbiomes . This knowledge will contribute to developing strategies to enhance beneficial interactions and mitigate the effects of pathogens that can reduce plant growth and productivity .
Intercellular and inter organ communication systems are vital for tissue homeostasis and disease development , utilizing soluble bioactive molecules for signaling . The field of extracellular vesicle ( EV ) biology has rapidly expanded in recent decades , highlighting EVs as effective bioactive nanovectors for cell to cell communication in various physiological and pathological contexts . Numerous studies indicate that adipocyte derived EVs are crucial components of the adipose secretome , playing a key role in autocrine and paracrine interactions within adipose tissue , as well as in endocrine signaling . This review aims to present an updated perspective on EVs as mediators of communication between adipose tissue and other organs , while also examining their therapeutic potential in the light of recent advancements in EV biology research .
Despite not proliferating , senescent cells remain metabolically active to maintain the senescence program . However , the mechanisms behind this metabolic reprogramming are not well understood . We identify senescence induced long noncoding RNA ( sin lncRNA ) , a previously uncharacterized long noncoding RNA ( lncRNA ) , a key player in this response . While strongly activated in senescence by C/EBPbeta , sin lncRNA loss reinforces the senescence program by altering oxidative phosphorylation and rewiring mitochondrial metabolism . By interacting with dihydrolipoamide S succinyltransferase ( DLST ) , it facilitates its mitochondrial localization . Depletion of sin lncRNA causes DLST nuclear translocation , leading to transcriptional changes in oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) genes . While not expressed in highly proliferative cancer cells , it is strongly induced upon cisplatin induced senescence . Depletion of sin lncRNA in ovarian cancer cells reduces oxygen consumption and increases extracellular acidification , sensitizing cells to cisplatin treatment . Altogether , these results indicate that sin lncRNA is specifically induced in senescence to maintain metabolic homeostasis , unveiling an RNA dependent metabolic rewiring specific to senescent cells .
Polyneuropathy remains a diagnostic and clinical challenge , with limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying painful and nonpainful phenotypes . While previous studies have examined various characteristics of these patients , the temporal and spatial dynamics of endogenous pain modulation remains not fully elucidated . In this study , offset analgesia ( OA ) and spatial summation of pain ( SSp ) were used as measures of pain modulation in individuals with distal symmetric polyneuropathy , stratified by the presence ( n = 30 ) or absence of pain ( n = 30 ) , and compared with healthy controls ( n = 30 ) . All participants underwent quantitative sensory testing and assessments of OA and SSp using a thermal stimulator applied to the dorsum of the foot . Patients with painful polyneuropathy exhibited enhanced SSp compared with the pain free polyneuropathy group and healthy controls ( P < 05 ) , and impaired OA compared with healthy controls ( P < 05 ) . The pain free neuropathy group showed less efficient OA and a slightly enhanced SSp , but this finding did not reach significance . The data suggest that changes in spatial summation were primarily driven by heightened pain responses to nociceptive input from smaller areas , rather than larger ones . Notably , spatial summation and the effects of OA were found to be correlated , irrespective of pain diagnosis . These findings underscore specific impairments in endogenous pain modulation in individuals with painful neuropathy , thus advancing our understanding of its pathophysiological mechanisms . They further highlight the differential roles of spatial and temporal dynamics in pain modulation across various neuropathic populations , offering promising avenues for improved diagnostics and prognostics related to polyneuropathy associated pain .
OBJECTIVES : Evidence for the association between methotrexate use and liver fibrosis in psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) remains inconclusive . We aimed to explore the frequency of liver fibrosis in PsA and identify associated factors including cumulative methotrexate dose and metabolic features . METHODS : We analyzed data from a prospective observational PsA cohort . We calculated the Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index ( APRI ) , a non invasive marker commonly used to assess fibrosis in patients with liver diseases . A cutoff of > 7 was used to denote liver fibrosis . We conducted univariable and multivariable generalized estimating equations ( GEE ) analysis to assess the impact of cumulative methotrexate dose and metabolic factors on liver fibrosis , adjusting for confounders such as demographic characteristics , comorbidities , and medications . RESULTS : 1 , 314 patients were included in the study , with a mean age of 4 ( SD 1 ) at baseline ( clinic entry ) . Of these , 375 ( 5% ) patients were receiving methotrexate at baseline , while 763 ( 1% ) had ever received the medication . Forty four ( 3% ) patients fulfilled the definition of liver fibrosis per APRI at baseline , while 154 ( 7% ) developed liver fibrosis during follow up at a median of 6 [IQR : 0 1] years from baseline . In the multivariable model , adjusted for confounders , cumulative methotrexate dose was not independently associated with liver fibrosis ( OR 99 , 95% CI 98 01 ) . However , higher BMI ( OR 03 , 95% CI 00 05 ) and diabetes mellitus ( OR 03 , 95% CI 19 56 ) showed a significant association . CONCLUSION : Metabolic factors , rather than the cumulative methotrexate dose , are associated with liver fibrosis in PsA .
S adenosyl L methionine ( SAM ) is an important intermediate metabolite and widely used in the treatment of liver disease , arthritis , and depression . In this work , a whole cell catalysis strategy was employed to enhance SAM production by combining the SAM biosynthetic pathway with an adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) regeneration system in Escherichia coli . Specifically , the ado1 , ack , and adk genes were previously introduced into the genome of the host strain . We then confirmed the availability of the ATP regeneration system under the condition of adding adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) and acetyl phosphate ( ACP ) as supplements . To improve the SAM production , the sam2 gene derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was overexpressed using the plasmid pGEX 2TK in the strain and the conditions of biocatalytic process were optimized . Under the optimal biocatalytic conditions , the recombinant strain RS01 ( pGEX 2TK SAM2 ) achieved a SAM titer of 4 g/L after 10 h cultivation . This work not only provides a new platform for the efficient production of SAM but also offers insights into the biosynthesis of other ATP dependent products . FAU Pengfei , Zhang
Enhancers play critical roles in gene expression , but a full understanding of their complex functions has yet to be defined . The cellular response to excess zinc levels in Caenorhabditis elegans requires the HIZR 1 transcription factor , which binds the high zinc activation ( HZA ) enhancer in the promoters of multiple target genes . Cadmium hijacks the excess zinc response by binding and activating HIZR By analyzing the genome wide transcriptional response to excess zinc and cadmium , we identified two positions in the genome where head to head oriented genes are both induced by metals . In both examples , a single predicted HZA enhancer is positioned between the two translational start sites . We hypothesized that a single enhancer can control both head to head genes , an arrangement that has not been extensively characterized . To test this hypothesis , we used CRISPR genome editing to precisely delete the HZAmT enhancer positioned between mtl 2 and T08G1 ; in this mutant , both head to head genes display severely reduced zinc activated transcription , whereas zinc activated transcription of more distant genes was not strongly affected . Deleting the HZAcF enhancer positioned between cdr 1 and F35E10 caused both head to head genes to display reduced cadmium activated transcription , whereas cadmium activated transcription of more distant genes was not strongly affected . These studies rigorously document that a single HZA enhancer can control two head to head genes , advancing our understanding of the diverse functions of enhancers .
Engineered cyclic peptides ( ECPs ) have been in the spotlight as novel drug modalities for challenging therapeutic targets . Oral delivery of engineered cyclic peptides benefits from ease of administration . However , one of the main hurdles in developing orally effective peptide drugs is their potential metabolic instability due to enzymatic degradation . To that end , in vitro experiments with simulated intestinal fluid ( SIF ) have been used to assess drug metabolic stability in the gastrointestinal tract . Currently , metabolic stability evaluations and biotransformation assessments are performed separately , which can be time consuming and result in complex data analysis . Presented here is a sample multiplexing strategy to address these challenges by leveraging a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer with two complementary analyzers , enabling the simultaneous analysis of metabolic stability from the Orbitrap full scan and biotransformation from the Astral analyzer from one sample injection . Furthermore , we demonstrate that 10 engineered cyclic peptides can be pooled into one sample injection without compromising the data quality to decrease the instrument run time and improve the throughput of the assay .

The Candidate Phyla Radiation , also known as Patescibacteria , represents a vast and diverse division of bacteria that has come to light via culture independent ' omics ' technologies . Their limited biosynthetic capacity , along with evidence of their growth as obligate epibionts on other bacteria , suggests a broad reliance on host organisms for their survival . Nevertheless , our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing their metabolism and lifestyle remains limited . The type IV secretion system ( T4SS ) represents a superfamily of translocation systems with a wide range of functional roles . T4SS genes have been identified in the Patescibacteria class Saccharimonadia as essential for their epibiotic growth . In this study , we used a comprehensive bioinformatics approach to investigate the diversity and distribution of T4SS within Patescibacteria . The phylogenetic analysis of the T4SS signature protein VirB4 suggests that most of these proteins cluster into a distinct monophyletic group with a shared ancestry to the MPF ( FATA ) class of T4SS . This class is found in the conjugative elements of Firmicutes , Actinobacteria , Tenericutes and Archaea , indicating a possible horizontal gene transfer from these monoderm micro organisms to Patescibacteria . We identified additional T4SS components near virB4 , particularly those associated with the MPF ( FATA ) class , as well as homologues of other T4SS classes , such as VirB2 like pilins , and observed their varied arrangements across different Patescibacteria classes . The absence of a relaxase in most of these T4SS clusters suggests that the system has been co opted for other functions in Patescibacteria . The proximity of T4SS components to the origin of replication ( gene dnaA ) in some Patescibacteria suggests a potential mechanism for increased expression . The broad ubiquity of a phylogenetically distinct T4SS , combined with its chromosomal location , underscores the significance of T4SS in the biology of Patescibacteria .

Cold ischemia significantly affects tissue sample quality and analytical accuracy . However , research on the effects of cold ischemia on tissue proteomics and metabolomics is limited , and efficient tools for assessing tissue quality are lacking . In this study , mass spectrometry ( MS ) based proteomics and metabolomics were employed to evaluate the impact of cold ischemia times and temperature , and MS imaging ( MSI ) was explored as a high throughput platform for tissue quality assessment . Our findings indicated that the proteome exhibits greater overall stability than the metabolome and that cold ischemia at 25 degrees C causes tissue molecular degradation more rapidly than at 4 degrees C . We also identified functional pathways particularly sensitive to cold ischemia , including the upregulation of cellular detoxification and small molecule metabolism , alongside the inhibition of nucleotide excision repair functions . Additionally , MALDI MSI can identify the change in certain highly unsaturated lipids caused by cold ischemia . Specifically , phosphatatidylcholines ( 40 : 6 ) and phosphatatidylcholines ( 34 : 3 ) showed sensitivities of 67% and specificities of 89% for identifying ' ' low quality ' ' leiomyoma tissues , indicating their potential as quality biomarkers . These insights can guide sample collection and selection strategies based on analytical objectives and provide a theoretical basis for preanalysis quality management . FAU Su , Rong
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) wound infections remain a significant global challenge and demand new generation biomaterials to eliminate bacterial infections and promote rapid wound healing . Although the nanozyme is a promising approach , the restricted unimodal bactericidal functionality hinders its efficacy in treating complex wound infections . In this study , copper tannic acid ( Cu TA ) nanozymes ( NMs ) with multifunctional properties were developed for the treatment of bacterial infections and biofilms via cuproptosis like cell death . The as prepared Cu TA demonstrated peroxidase like ( POD like ) activity , generating substantial amounts of hydroxyl radicals ( ( * ) OH ) . In vitro studies revealed that Cu TA efficiently disrupted bacterial biofilms , while in vivo experiments demonstrated its ability to promote anti inflammatory responses , angiogenesis , collagen synthesis , and cellular proliferation . Transcriptome sequencing revealed that bacterial reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) caused damage to the cell membrane and disrupted metabolic processes . Furthermore , copper overload triggered lipid peroxidation ( LPO ) buildup and interfered with the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle , culminating in cuproptosis like bacterial death . Overall , this study successfully developed a spindle shaped , multifunctional nanozyme for combating bacterial infections through cuproptosis like cell death while promoting infected wound healing . The results validate the clinical potential of Cu TA NMs for treating MRSA infected wounds . FAU Yu , Chongqing
IMPORTANCE : Educational attainment is a key social determinant of cardiometabolic disease in adulthood , yet knowledge about the pathways through which educational experiences in childhood may shape cardiometabolic health is limited . OBJECTIVE : To explore whether associations between educational experiences in childhood and cardiometabolic health in adulthood are mediated by adult socioeconomic status and health behaviors . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : Participants were from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ( NICHD ) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development ( SECCYD ) , a birth cohort ( 1991 2009 ) recruited to participate in a 30 year assessment ( ages 26 31 ) between January 2018 and December 2022 focused on cardiometabolic health outcomes . EXPOSURES : Exposures were child educational indicators ( student social competence , student teacher relationship quality , classroom emotional and instructional quality , and academic achievement ) , and adult pathways were mediators ( income , educational level , diet quality , activity level , sleep duration , and smoking status ) . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES : The primary outcome was a composite measure of metabolic syndrome , in which assessments of waist circumference , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , levels of hemoglobin A1c , C reactive protein , and high density lipoprotein were combined to form a single unit standardized index of cardiometabolic risk ( CMR ) . RESULTS : Among 700 participants ( 374 female [4%] ; mean [SD] age , 6 [2] years ; 70 [0%] Black , 45 [4%] Latino , 552 [9%] White , and 33 [7%] other ) , linear regression models supported the role of adult income and adult diet quality as mediators . Independent of covariates ( sex , race and ethnicity , child body mass index percentile , and parental socioeconomic status ) , adult income mediated associations between indicators , including student social competence ( b = 001 ; 95% CI , 002 to 0003 ; P = . 02 ) , student teacher relationship quality ( b = 002 ; 95% CI , 004 to 001 ; P = . 02 ) , classroom instructional quality ( b = 012 ; 95% CI , 034 to 001 ; P = . 06 for trend ) , and academic achievement ( b = 001 ; 95% CI , 002 to 0004 ; P = . 02 ) , and adult CMR . Adult diet quality mediated associations between indicators , including student social competence ( b = 002 ; 95% CI , 004 to 001 ; P < . 001 ) and student teacher relationship quality ( b = 003 ; 95% CI , 005 to 001 ; P = . 01 ) , and adult CMR . Results for the other candidate mediators were nonsignificant . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE : In this birth cohort study , results showed that associations between educational experiences in childhood and cardiometabolic health in adulthood were mediated by adult income for 4 of 5 indicators and by adult diet for 2 of 5 indicators . This suggests that , across diverse educational experiences , long term health benefits may be transmitted through having a higher adult income and a healthier adult diet . Findings offer a developmental framework for understanding the well established education health gradient , highlighting opportunities for early health promotion . FAU Bleil , Maria E
PURPOSE : Glial cells play a critical role in primary visual cortex ( V1 region ) damage caused by optic nerve injury , but the mechanisms driving progression of V1 region injury and glial cell heterogeneity remain poorly understood . This study aimed to investigate the damage changes in the V1 region of mice after optic nerve crush ( ONC ) by single cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA seq ) . METHODS : Hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate the changes of retinal thickness , astrocytes , and microglia in the V1 region after ONC in mice . Single cell suspensions in the V1 region of mice were prepared and analyzed by scRNA seq with Seurat , cellchat , CytoTRACE in R software . The expression of PTGDS and CRYAB was measured by qPCR , Western blot , and immunofluorescence . RESULTS : After unilateral ONC , retinal thinning in both eyes and activation of astrocytes and microglia in contralateral V1 region were observed . Genes related to neuroinflammation and apoptosis in the bilateral V1 region were upregulated , and the related pathways included MAPK , TNF , and apoptosis signaling pathways . Notably , the V1 region contralateral to the ONC eye exhibited more pronounced differential gene expression , and the protein expression of neuroinflammation related genes Ptgds and Cryab increased . We further investigated the heterogeneity and pseudotime trajectories of astrocytes and microglia , demonstrating the key branches that dominate neuroinflammation . CONCLUSIONS : This study generates an atlas of the V1 region of the mouse brain , highlighting the role of astrocytes and microglia in the damage changes in the V1 region after ONC , and suggesting Ptgds and Cryab as potential targets to reduce neuroinflammation .

PURPOSE : Mutations affecting the CRB1 gene produce retinal dystrophies including early onset severe retinal dystrophy/Leber congenital amaurosis ( EOSRD/LCA ) , retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) , cone rod dystrophy ( CORD ) , and macular dystrophy ( MD ) . As treatment strategies advance toward clinical translation , there is a need to establish reliable outcome metrics and to better understand the visual deficits associated with CRB1 retinopathies . To this end , we measured visual acuity ( VA ) and crowding ( the disruptive effect of clutter on object recognition ) , both key functions in spatial vision , using child friendly computer based tests , and gold standard clinical measures . METHODS : Patients with molecularly confirmed biallelic CRB1 pathogenic variants were compared with age matched controls ( n = 20 in each ) . Best corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) was measured with both Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) and the computerized VacMan procedures ( using an unflanked/isolated VacMan target ) , which also allowed measurement of crowding when surrounding flanker elements were added . RESULTS : Both acuity and crowding were significantly elevated in individuals with CRB1 retinopathy compared with controls . ETDRS acuity correlated with both the unflanked ( r = 868 , P < 001 ) and flanked VacMan thresholds ( r = 748 , P < 001 ) . No statistically significant changes in crowding were observed with respect to CRB1 phenotype ( EOSRD/LCA , CORD , or MD ) or age of onset . CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates for the first time that individuals with CRB1 retinopathy exhibit elevated crowding in their foveal vision compared with controls . Measuring crowding offers valuable insights into understanding functional visual deficits in CRB1 retinopathy and could be a useful metric for monitoring disease progression and treatment outcomes in inherited retinal diseases .

PURPOSE : Corneal endothelial cell dysfunction is a major contributor to corneal edema , opacity , and , in severe cases , corneal blindness . Currently , no direct and reliable clinical indicator is available for evaluating the function of corneal endothelial cells . This study aimed to identify new noninvasive indicators for the clinical assessment of corneal endothelial barrier function . METHODS : This study established a finite element simulation model of a monolayer full corneal endothelium to screen for sensitive indicators that reflect the barrier function of the corneal endothelium . Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) was used to observe the morphology of endothelial junctions , and immunofluorescence was used to examine the expression of fluorescent particles . RESULTS : The " Y junctions " area was identified as the parameter most sensitive to changes in intraocular pressure when considering the different analytical indices obtained from the finite element model . SEM of Corneal endothelial dysfunction models in rabbits and mice further confirmed a substantial increase in the " Y junctions " relative to control groups . Additionally , functional in vitro experiments provided further evidence of a positive relationship between larger " Y junctions " and enhanced permeability to fluorescent particles . Finally , clinical analysis of measurements related to " Y junctions " in patients suffering from various corneal endothelial disorders consistently revealed that these junctions were significantly larger compared to those observed in healthy control subjects . CONCLUSIONS : The " Y junctions " area serves as a potentially sensitive indicator for assessing endothelial barrier integrity . Consistent observation of alterations in this area may facilitate the early identification of dysfunction in circulating endothelial cells . FAU Li , Dongfang
PURPOSE : Cataract is believed to be caused by protein protein and protein membrane aggregation in the eye lens . After middle age , there is extensive binding of crystallins to the lens cell membranes as evidenced by sedimentation at high densities . Multiple protein modifications have been linked with cataract , whereas others have been associated with aging . The purpose of this study was to characterize protein constituents within high density protein membrane fractions from normal aged or cataractous lenses and to compare these proteins and their modifications . METHODS : The inner nuclear regions of cataract or age matched normal lenses were homogenized and proteins were separated using sucrose density gradient centrifugation . The low density fractions ( LDFs ) and high density fractions ( HDFs ) were analyzed by mass spectrometry using both top down matrix assisted desorption/ionization mass spectrometry ( MALDI MS ) and bottom up liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC MS/MS ) based proteomic methods . Quantification of low molecular weight crystallin peptides , deamidation , and isomerization were performed . RESULTS : Compared with normal aged lenses , membrane associated protein aggregates in high density fractions of cataract lenses exhibited significantly higher levels of gamma crystallins , as well as gammaS and gammaD crystallin C terminal peptides . Deamidation of gamma crystallin , but not of beta crystallin , was increased in cataract lens membrane bound aggregates . A very high level of Asp isomerization was detected in bound alpha crystallins from both aged and cataract lenses . CONCLUSIONS : Binding of crystallin aggregates to human lens cell membranes is associated with protein truncation , deamidation , and isomerization , and was observed in normal aged and cataract lenses . However , the protein aggregates bound to membranes in cataract lenses exhibit distinct modifications to gamma crystallins that may arise as a consequence of additional protein degradation .

PURPOSE : Pathological epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) of lens epithelial cells ( LECs ) plays a crucial role in the formation of lens fibrosis , particularly in fibrotic posterior capsular opacification and anterior subcapsular cataract ( ASC ) . Here we investigated the potential roles of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress in the development of lens fibrosis . METHODS : RNA sequencing was performed to examine global gene expression changes in patients with ASC , as well as in TGFbeta2 induced human lens explants and rabbit primary LECs . Rabbit LECs were treated with TGFbeta2 in the presence or absence of the ER stress modulator , PERK inhibitor ISRIB , and autophagy inducer for in vitro studies . In vivo investigations were carried out using a mouse model of injury induced capsular fibrosis , with ISRIB administration . To uncover the underlying mechanisms , we conducted lipidomics analysis , transmission electron microscopy , immunostaining , quantitative PCR , Western blot , and capillary Western immunoassay . RESULTS : ER stress genes were upregulated in patients with ASC , TGFbeta2 stimulated human explants and primary LECs . Pharmacologic ER stress induction promoted EMT , while its inhibition reduced TGFbeta2 induced mesenchymal gene levels . Blocking the PERK axis of ER stress with ISRIB or targeting downstream factor ATF4 suppressed EMT , whereas the IRE1 axis showed no effect . Consistent with these in vitro observations , anterior chamber injection of ISRIB also reduced subcapsular plaque formation in a mouse model of lens fibrosis by suppressing SMAD2/3 activation . Mechanistically , ISRIB suppressed LC3 II conversion and P62 degradation , indicating autophagy suppression . Lipidomics revealed phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , essential for autophagosome formation , was downregulated in TGFbeta2 treated LECs and upregulated with ISRIB cotreatment . Inducing autophagy with rapamycin significantly rescued the mesenchymal gene suppression by ISRIB , whereas autophagy inhibitor CQ produced opposite effects . CONCLUSIONS : ER stress , particularly the PERK axis , promotes LECs ' EMT through autophagy and PE metabolism , offering potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of lens fibrosis .

BACKGROUND : The association between social risk and biomarkers of inflammation remains underexplored in low resource communities , where social risk and levels of inflammation differ from those in industrialized urban centers . This study aims to assess the association between levels of social risk and biomarkers of inflammation in adults residing in remote rural settings . METHODS : This population based , cross sectional study involved 1392 community dwellers aged >/=40 years . Social risk was assessed using the social determinants of health ( SDH ) included in Gijon ' s Social Familial Evaluation Scale ( SFES ) . Biomarkers of inflammation were measured through the Systemic Immune Inflammation Index ( SII ) and the C Reactive Protein ( CRP ) /albumin ratio . Both unadjusted and multivariate models were fitted to determine the independent association between SDH and biomarkers of inflammation , treated as dependent variables . RESULTS : The mean ( +/ SD ) age of 1392 study participants was 8 +/ 5 years ( 59% women ) . The mean Gijon ' s SFES score was 1 +/ 6 points , the mean SII was 6 +/ 5 x 10 L , and the mean CRP/albumin ratio was 13 +/ Unadjusted generalized linear regression models demonstrated direct significant associations between SDH scores and both dependent variables , including SII ( beta : 12 ; 95% CI : 35 89 ) and the CRP/albumin ratio ( beta : 03 ; 95% CI : 01 05 ) . These associations remained significant after adjusting for demographics , level of education , and cardiovascular risk factors for both , the SII ( beta : 24 ; 95% CI : 08 41 ) and the CRP/albumin ratio ( beta : 03 ; 95% CI : 01 05 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Social risk is directly associated with biomarkers of inflammation in the study population , suggesting that inflammation may be associated with adverse health outcomes in individuals with high social risk . Study results demonstrate that this association is not only evident in high income regions but in underserved rural communities as well . FAU Del Brutto , Oscar H
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances ( PFASs ) are emerging contaminants widely found in drinking water and food , potentially entering the human body through these sources . To investigate these effects , we simulated PFAS exposure doses in animal models , ranging from general population to occupational levels , and analyzed blood and spleen samples . Epidemiological studies linked PFAS exposure to immunosuppression and hematotoxicity , while toxicogenomic analyses validated the underlying biological mechanisms . PFAS exposure caused immunotoxic effects , including altered blood parameters and lymphocyte edema . Cellular abnormalities such as decreased cytoplasmic density , incomplete rough endoplasmic reticulum , chromatin condensation , lymphocyte nuclear shrinkage , and reduced mitochondrial cristae were observed . Epidemiological evidence revealed a dose response relationship between mixed PFAS exposure and hematologic indices such as hematocrit ( HCT ) , hemoglobin ( HGB ) , platelet count ( PLT ) , platelet to lymphocyte ratio ( PLR ) , white blood cell count ( WBC ) , monocyte percentage , and platelet large cell ratio ( PLCR ) , with perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) playing a dominant role . Toxicogenomic analysis identified genes associated with platelets , anemia , and leukocyte function , linked to inflammation , Th17 cell differentiation , apoptosis , lipid metabolism , atherosclerosis , and JAK STAT signaling . This study provides novel insights into the hematotoxicity and immunosuppressive effects of mixed PFAS exposure , emphasizing the need for PFAS substitution , removal , and policies addressing mixed exposures to protect public health .

LIPUS , low intensity pulsed ultrasounds , are considered a safe and non invasive tool that have been used extensively in medicine for chronic diseases . We evaluated the effects produced by LIPUS on the physiological behaviour of mouse and human adipose stem cells ( ASCs ) as well as on adipose tissue explants . LIPUS stimulation for one minute did not affect mouse or human ASC proliferation or apoptosis , with no evident changes in morphology or cell growth . Further , RNA seq analysis revealed more than 200 genes differentially expressed after ultrasound stimulation of mouse and human ASCs . Among them , the changes in gene expression mainly belong to the canonical pathways of stemness , energy metabolism or chemokine signalling . On the other hand , the migration ability of mouse and human ASCs was partially affected by the ultrasound protocol , slightly increasing their capacity to migrate , while maintaining their stemness properties . Major affection was detected on the adipocyte differentiation capacity . Indeed , LIPUS treated ASCs were unable to differentiate into mature adipocytes and their inflammatory secretion profile was reduced in both mouse and human ASCs . These effects were confirmed on an ex vivo model of adipose tissue explants , demonstrating that LIPUS also provoked an anti inflammatory profile in the adipose tissue while reducing adipocytes differentiation and lipids content . Overall , the strong adipogenesis blockade , the reduction of their secretion profile and the RNA seq analysis suggest that LIPUS treated ASCs may be prevented from differentiating into mature adipocytes and from exacerbating inflammation , thus limiting their contribution to obesity .
The association between obesity and cancer risk carries substantial public health ramifications as obesity promotes cancer advancement via many cellular and molecular mechanisms . This study utilizes Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses ( PRISMA ) and narrative systematic review guidelines to evaluate 221 research articles selected from an initial collection of 1 , 288 publications sourced from multiple databases . Obesity driven cancer risk is linked to hormonal imbalances including increased oestrogen levels that heighten the likelihood of breast and endometrial cancers , and insulin resistance that activates the insulin/ Insulin and Insulin like Growth Factor 1 ( IGF 1 ) pathway promoting colorectal cancer progression . Chronic low grade inflammation , metabolic dysfunction , and hypoxia in expanding adipose tissue contribute to pancreatic , oesophageal , colorectal , renal , and liver malignancies . Recent research has identified novel mechanisms that drive obesity induced cancer progression . The adipose tissue secretome , extracellular vesicle mediated lipid and RNA transfer , ferroptosis resistance , and metabolic reprogramming via Cluster of Differentiation 36 ( CD36 ) , Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4 ( FABP4 ) , and Carnitine Palmitoyl transferase 1A ( CPT1A ) create a tumour permissive microenvironment . Obesity induced epigenetic memory sustains cancer risk even after weight loss through persistent histone modifications ( Histone H3 Lysine 4 Trimethylation ( H3K4me3 ) , Histone H3 Lysine 27 Trimethylation ( H3K27me3 ) , DNA methylation , and RNA modifications , particularly through the Fat Mass and Obesity Associated ( FTO ) gene . Additionally , organ and cell size expansion increase mutation susceptibility . Emerging pathways including the Von Hippel Lindau ( VHL ) Hypoxia Inducible Factor ( HIF ) axis , PR Domain Zinc Finger Protein 16 ( PRDM16 ) /Uncoupling Protein 1 ( UCP1 ) inhibition , Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) driven FABP4 upregulation , and Yes Associated Protein ( YAP ) /Transcriptional Co Activator with PDZ Binding Motif ( TAZ ) signalling , further highlight obesity ' s role in oncogenesis . Future research should investigate weight loss drugs ' effects on cancer pathways , expand demographic diversity , and develop biomarkers for adiposity . Integrating Mendelian randomization , multi omics , and artificial intelligence could reveal novel therapeutic targets . A comprehensive prevention strategy combining lifestyle interventions , pharmacological therapies , and biomarker driven diagnostics is crucial to reducing obesity related cancer burden and improving patient outcomes .
The escalating threat of antibiotic resistance , particularly in Staphylococcus aureus ( including methicillin resistant strains , MRSA ) , underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutics . Sofalcone ( Sof ) , a chalcone derivative from Sophora subprostrata with established anti inflammatory and anti ulcer properties , exhibits promising yet underexplored antibacterial activity . Here , we demonstrate that Sof potently inhibits S . aureus and MRSA while showing minimal cytotoxicity in human cells . Notably , Sof synergized with amoxicillin , and significantly reduced the pathogenicity of S . aureus through inhibiting biofilm formation addressing key virulence factors . Through chemoproteomic profiling using a clickable Sof derived probe , ribosomal proteins , specifically the 50S subunit protein rplB , were identified as primary targets . Sof covalently binds to rplB via cysteine residues , as validated by cellular thermal shift assays , microscale thermophoresis , and competition assays . Bio orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging revealed that Sof disrupts bacterial protein synthesis by impairing ribosomal function , a mechanism distinct from conventional antibiotics . In a murine model of S . aureus induced acute lung injury , Sof greatly reduced bacterial load in lungs , attenuated systemic inflammation , and mitigated histopathological damage . Its dual antibacterial and anti inflammatory efficacy , coupled with activity against Gram negative Escherichia coli , highlights broad spectrum potential . This study unveils a covalent ribosomal targeting strategy , positioning Sof as a multifaceted candidate against multidrug resistant infections . Our findings bridge natural product pharmacology and mechanistic antimicrobial discovery , offering a template for combating the global antibiotic resistance crisis .
Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is one of the most common tumors in the world . A recent area of study for the treatment of patients with solid tumors is anti tumor immunity . PD 1/PD L1 inhibitors were beneficial for cancer patients with multiple tumor types . However , their efficacy for CRC is low . Thus , there is an urgent need to explore additional co inhibitory tools such as VISTA for CRC treatment . ObjectiveThe current study aimed to evaluate expression of VISTA on T cell subsets in patients with CRC and its correlation with other prognostic markers . Patients and methodsThe study included 31 patients with CRC and 25 healthy controls . All participants were subjected to full history taking , clinical examination , routine laboratory investigations , and flow cytometric detection of VISTA expression on T cell subsets on peripheral blood ( PB ) . In addition to detection of VISTA expression on T cell subsets on tissue samples of both malignant CRC and normal colon tissue of the CRC patients . ResultsIn the peripheral blood , the expression of VISTA on CD4 ( + ) T helper and CD8 ( + ) T cytotoxic cells was significantly higher in CRC patients than the normal controls . There was no significant difference in VISTA expression on double positive T cells ( CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) ) between the CRC patients and normal controls . In tissue samples , expression of VISTA on CD4 + T helper , CD8 + T cytotoxic , and double positive T ( CD4 + CD8 + ) cells in the malignant tissue of CRC patients was significantly higher than that in normal colonic tissue . Also , in CRC patients , the expression of VISTA on CD4 ( + ) T helper , CD8 ( + ) T cytotoxic , and double positive T cells in both malignant CRC tissue and normal colonic tissue was significantly higher than its expression PB . ConclusionThe higher expression of VISTA in CRC patients than the healthy controls and its higher levels in malignant CRC tissue and normal colonic tissue than PB of CRC patients suggest the role VISTA in the pathogenesis of CRC .
OBJECTIVE : To investigate whether the incidence of dementia is associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) in type 2 diabetes . METHODS : Using the National Health Insurance Service National Health Information Database , we calculated the incidence of various types of dementia according to type 2 diabetes with or without DPN by applying multivariate Cox regression analysis . Propensity score matching was performed to equalize each group by considering demographic characteristics and underlying conditions . RESULTS : The incidence of various types of dementia was higher in patients with type 2 diabetes than in those without diabetes . The risk of developing dementia was higher in type 2 diabetes with DPN than in type 2 diabetes without DPN , irrespective of dementia type ( all dementia : 53 vs . 1 vs . 4 , P < 05 , Alzheimer ' s disease : 46 vs . 98 vs . 34 , P < 05 , vascular dementia : 86 vs . 75 vs . 66 , P < 05 , other dementia : 62 vs . 19 vs . 48 , P < 05 ; all type 2 diabetes vs . type 2 diabetes with DPN vs . type 2 diabetes without DPN compared with non diabetes ) . When sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors ( SGLT2Is ) were used , the incidence of all dementia types was lower in patients with type 2 diabetes than in patients with type 2 diabetes who did not use SGLT2Is although the incidence showed more decreased trend when dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor ( DPPIVI ) was combined ( all dementia : 51 71 , P < 05 , Alzheimer ' s disease : 78 80 , P < 05 , vascular dementia : 28 35 , P < 05 , other dementia : 2 70 , P < 05 ; SGLT2Is user vs . neither SGLT2I nor DPPIVI ) . This pattern was also observed in patients with type 2 diabetes and DPN ( all dementia : 32 56 , P < 05 , Alzheimer ' s disease : 44 55 , P < 05 , vascular dementia : 33 , P < 05 , other dementia : 53 , P < 05 ; SGLT2Is user vs . neither SGLT2I nor DPPIVI ) . CONCLUSIONS : More active diagnostic and prevention efforts are needed to address the risk of developing all forms of dementia , including vascular dementia , in patients with diabetes and DPN .
Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is a common and frequent disease and always leads to endocrine and metabolic disorders among women of reproductive age . In most PCOS patients , the serum level of anti mullerian hormone ( AMH ) is significantly higher than that of normal women of childbearing age . AMH is an important auxiliary diagnostic method for PCOS . AMH may play an important role in the occurrence and development of PCOS and potentially affect the success of in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) treatments , although the exact mechanisms remain unclear . This review focuses on the relationships and mechanisms of dysregulated AMH and follicular development in PCOS based on recent research . It is mainly manifested in the regulation of related signal pathways , the negative feedback regulatory loop of several gonadal hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone , luteinizing hormone , estradiol , and testosterone , as well as the influence of AMH on IVF in PCOS patients . Additionally , it puts forward some suggestions , which will provide some helpful ideas or directions for future further research on PCOS .
Although evidence suggests that an imbalance in Th1 and Th2 cell responses contributes to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia , the epigenetic mechanisms involved remain largely unknown . Here , we applied a combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches to evaluate the alterations in Th1 and Th2 related genes in schizophrenia patients . Based on bioinformatics analysis , we selected Th1 ( IFNG AS1 , TBX21 , IFNG ) and Th2 related genes ( TH2LCRR , GATA3 , IL 4 ) , which are potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia . For experimental validation , we measured the expression levels of these transcripts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) from patients with acute phase schizophrenia and controls . Bioinformatics findings revealed 2 lncRNAs , 9 miRNAs , 76 mRNAs , and 234 transcription factors ( TFs ) related to Th1 and Th2 cell lineages , which are involved in schizophrenia . Subsequent analysis of qPCR data showed a remarkable increase in the expression levels of GATA3 and TH2LCRR in the PBMCs of patients with schizophrenia compared to controls . Interestingly , both TH2LCRR and GATA3 exhibited greater diagnostic value in female subjects . However , our data showed no significant difference in the expression levels of Th1 related genes ( IFNG AS1 , TBX21 , IFNG ) and IL 4 between diagnostic groups . Furthermore , the expression levels of IFNG AS1 and TH2LCRR were positively correlated with cytokine expression in patient subjects . These findings further support the pivotal role of Th1/Th2 imbalance in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia . Our data highlight the necessity to evaluate the potential efficacy of immune related genes to identify promising biomarkers for both the diagnosis and therapy of patients with schizophrenia .
Dysregulation of hepatic metabolism is a crucial factor in the development of fatty liver disease and significantly increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . This study aims to identify the genes implicated in the prognosis of HCC among individuals suffering from metabolic fatty liver disease . We analysed protein protein interaction ( PPI ) networks and constructed a weighted gene co expression network analysis ( WGCNA ) using high throughput gene expression profiling datasets . Our meta analysis uncovered 442 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) , comprising 30 upregulated and 412 downregulated genes . We constructed a PPI network from the DEGs and identified significant hub genes based on their degree centrality scores . Additionally , WGCNA highlighted impactful genes and tightly correlated modules , leading to the creation of a gene interaction network specific to metabolism associated fatty liver disease ( MAFLD ) . Pathway analysis revealed the candidate regulatory gene interleukin 7 receptor ( IL7R ) , which is involved in cytokine mediated signalling across both interaction networks . Pro inflammatory cytokines interact with IL7R , activating the JAK/STAT pathway that influences gene expression throughout progression to HCC . IL7R activates STAT3 , affecting the behaviour of activated hepatic stellate cells following initial liver damage . Furthermore , the expression of the IL7R gene was validated as a predictor of HCC malignancy through a logistic regression model , resulting in an accuracy of 92% . Findings suggest that IL7R could be the target gene associated with metabolism linked HCC . It could significantly impact the management of metabolic associated fatty liver disease ( MAFLD ) and may help enhance HCC diagnostics to improve patient outcomes .
BACKGROUND : Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota ( GM ) has been reported to be associated with cancers , including bladder cancer ( BLCA ) . However , the specific causal relationship between GM and BLCA , as well as the mediating role of circulating metabolic biomarkers ( CMBs ) , has remained unclear . Therefore , we aimed to elucidate the causal relationship among GM , CMBs , and BLCA , through a mendelian randomization ( MR ) approach . METHOD : The summary statistics of 473 GM ( n = 5959 ) and 233 CMBs ( n = 136 , 016 ) from the NHGRI EBI GWAS Catalog , and BLCA ( cases n = 2053 and controls n = 287 , 137 ) from the FinnGen study were leveraged for our research . Bidirectional MR analysis was conducted to investigate the causal link between GM and BLCA , and two step MR ( TSMR ) was employed to identified potential mediating CMBs . The inverse variance weighted ( IVW ) was primarily utilized for effect estimation . Additionally , the Cochrane ' s Q test was used to evaluate heterogeneity , and the MR Egger method was employed to evaluate pleiotropy . RESULT : The study revealed that 15 GM and 12 CMBs were causally associated with BLCA ( p < 05 ) . Specially , dorea was found to significantly increase the risk of developing BLCA ( OR = 20 , 95% CI : 29 75 ) . Furthermore , TSMR analysis indicated that total cholesterol levels in small HDL and cholesterol esters in small HDL mediate the causal relationship between dorea and BLCA , with mediated proportions of 46% and 14% , respectively . CONCLUSION : The findings of this study provide compelling evidence supporting the mediating role of CMBs in the causal relationship on GM and BLCA .
This article describes a robust method for dual labeling of newly synthesized proteins and existing proteins . Assessing the properties of individual newly synthesized proteins from the bulk proteome is challenging due to difficulty in specifically isolating them . Previous methods such as non natural amino acid labeling , isotope labeled amino acid labeling , and puromycin labeling are effective for ensemble measurements . However , these existing methods do not support live cell tracking or dynamic studies for a specific target protein . We designed a chemical genetics based method for selective labeling of existing and newly synthesized proteins ( ( CG ) SLENP ) . Using nuclear lamin A ( LA ) tagged with a HaloTag ( HaloTag LA ) as an exemplar protein and various Halo ligands , we describe ( CG ) SLENP for labeling existing proteins and newly synthesized proteins . This approach can label these proteins either one at a time or dually in the same live cell . This method holds great potential for broader applications to study any given protein of interest .

Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is the third most common cause of death worldwide and has high mortality and a poor prognosis . Long non coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) are non coding RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides that play roles in cancer through multiple mechanisms . TMEM51 AS1 is a newly discovered 40 , 650 bp lncRNA . Our results showed that TMEM51 AS1 expression was significantly downregulated in CRC tissues ( fold change = 74 , P < 0001 ) . This finding was confirmed in 20 pairs of CRC carcinoma and paracancerous tissues ( fold change = 5 , P < 001 ) . Additionally , TMEM51 AS1 expression was found to be significantly reduced in CRC cell lines compared to normal human intestinal epithelial cells ( P < 001 ) . Bioinformatic analysis revealed that TMEM51 AS1 expression was associated with immune escape , RNA methylation , and DNA damage and repair . TMEM51 AS1 may also activate energy metabolism pathways to participate in cancer development . Drug sensitivity analysis confirmed that several drugs are more effective in CRC patients with high expression of TMEM51 AS In conclusion , our study demonstrates that TMEM51 AS1 can suppress the progression of CRC .
PURPOSE OF REVIEW : This review explores the role of cell communication network ( CCN ) proteins in regulating skeletal physiology , aging , and disease , particularly within the context of balanced bone remodeling . RECENT FINDINGS : Recent conceptualization of paracrine and endocrine networks in bone marrow as a form of osteoimmunological crosstalk suggests a significant role for matricellular signaling in regulating bone homeostasis . As multifunctional adapters of cell matrix interactions , CCNs are emerging as a focal point for parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) signaling and regulation of the RANKL/RANK/OPG axis in skeletal aging . Altered bone marrow CCN expression creates a permissive environment for accelerated postmenopausal bone loss and may contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and other diseases related to skeletal aging . CCNs modulate fundamental signaling mechanisms in bone development , homeostasis and repair . During aging , dysregulation of CCNs may negatively affect skeletal health and contribute to disease progression . As a result , CCNs may constitute promising therapeutic targets for improving and maintaining aging bone health .
OBJECTIVES : Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is a primary contributor to chronic functional impairment in human populations , initiating complex neuroinflammatory cascades and neurodegeneration . Despite extensive research efforts , the precise pathophysiological pathways remain incompletely characterized . This investigation aims to establish a novel therapeutic strategy that targets critical molecular pathways post injury , potentially addressing the current limitations in the clinical management of TBI patients . METHODS : The single cell data of cortical tissue from mice with TBI were obtained from public databases ( GSE160763 ) , which was utilized to identify alterations in in the composition of disease associated cells and related molecules as the disease progresses . Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional characteristics of microglia and astrocyte subpopulations . Trajectory analysis was employed to investigate cell differentiation characteristics . Subsequently , we examined the expression and function of microglia specific molecules , such as IFI204 , along with their underlying molecular mechanisms using Western blotting , immunofluorescence , co immunoprecipitation ( CO IP ) , histopathology , behavioral tests , and molecular docking to assess binding status , as well as molecular dynamics simulations . Finally , we used molecular docking technology to find small molecule compounds that IFI204 can stably bind to . RESULTS : We identified nine major cell populations , most of which undergo dynamic changes following TBI . Astrocytes and microglia were the predominant populations in each group , and further cluster analysis revealed that the proportions of interferon ( IFN ) and axonogenesis related microglial subtypes increased after TBI . Trajectory inference analysis indicated that the expression of Ifi204 is upregulated in microglia during disease progression . Conditional microglial knockdown of IFI204 significantly improved neurological deficits in mice , and alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and microglial pyroptosis . Mechanistically , SENP7 , identified as a novel molecule , interacts with IFI204 in microglia , catalyzes the deSUMOylation of IFI204 , and promotes STING signal activation , ultimately driving microglial pyroptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction . CONCLUSIONS : The interaction between IFI204 and SENP7 promotes microglial pyroptosis and related mitochondrial dysfunction . Furthermore , in the case of TBI , we hypothesize that targeting IFI204 might yield therapeutic benefits .
Benzo[a]pyrene ( B[a]P ) is known to cause depression like symptoms in mice , however , the mechanisms are still unclear . The present study aimed to establish a mouse model of depression like behavior induced by B[a]P and to elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms . Forty robust male ICR mice were randomly categorized into 4 groups and received intraperitoneal injections ( i . p . ) of peanut oil or B[a]P at doses of 5 , 2 , or 10 mg/kg , 30 times over a period of 60 days . Behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate depression like symptoms , identify neuronal structural alterations and cellular apoptosis , and measure the protein levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) , phosphorylated TrkB ( p TrkB ) , cAMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) and phosphorylated CREB ( p CREB ) in the cerebral cortex . To further explore the regulatory role of miRNA , small RNA sequencing was performed in HT22 cells treated with B[a]P at concentrations of 2 , 2 , and 20 microM , which revealed the dysregulated miRNA expression profiles . The interaction between miR 134 5p and BDNF mRNA was examined , along with its inhibitory effects in both in vivo and in vitro contexts . Findings indicated that B[a]P exposure significantly induced depression like behavior and neuronal damage in mice in a dose dependent manner , in contrast to the controls , and was associated with a reduction in BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway proteins in the cerebral cortex . As compared to the respective controls , B[a]P exposure notably triggered an irregular miRNA expression profile ( encompassing miR 10b 5p , miR 124 3p , miR 134 5p , and miR 155 5p ) in both the cerebral cortex of mice and HT22 cells . Owing to its uniform alterations in expression profiles in vivo and in vitro , miR 134 5p was chosen as the target miRNA for follow up mechanistic research employing a miR 134 5p inhibitor ( at concentrations of 100 nM ) in HT22 cells . Following a 48 hour in vitro treatment with B[a]P ( 20 microM ) , there was a notable reduction in proteins linked to the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway , in contrast to DMSO controls . This decrease was markedly ameliorated in HT22 cells that had been transfected with the miR 134 5p inhibitor . The research uncovered the pivotal function of the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway in B[a]P induced depressive like behavior in vivo , and showed a regulatory role of miR 134 5p in this pathway . These findings suggest a potential intervention target against the depression like behaviors resulting from B[a]P exposure .
Ischemic stroke ( IS ) is a severe disease . The altered activation states of microglia play important roles in IS . In present study , a total of 125 C57BL/6 mice was used ( N = 6 per group ) . Middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) and oxygen glucose deprivation ( OGD ) were performed for in vivo and in vitro model construction . The infarct size was detected using TTC staining . The nerve injury was evaluated by a neurological deficit score . OGD treated brain microvascular endothelial cells ( BMECs ) were co cultured with BV2 cells . Cell viability was determined by CCK 8 assay , and the apoptosis rate was identified by flow cytometry analysis . Transendothelial electronic resistance ( TEER ) of the cells was measured by TEER measurement . Molecular interactions were analyzed using dual luciferase reporter gene , ChIP , and Co IP assays . All in vitro experiments were conducted with three replicates , and each experiment was performed in triplicate . We found that Src Homology 2B Adaptor Protein 3 ( SH2B3 ) was overexpressed in the cerebral cortex tissues of MCAO treated mice ( P < 01 ) , and BMECs co cultured with BV 2 cells under OGD conditions ( P < 01 ) . SH2B3 knockdown or Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 A ( MEF2A ) overexpression reduced infarct size and improved neurological function in MCAO mice . SH2B3 knockdown enhanced OGD treated cell viability ( P < 05 ) , inhibited cell apoptosis ( P < 05 ) in BMECs , and ameliorated BBB ( P < 01 ) . Moreover , SH2B3 knockdown changed the activation status of microglia . MEF2A promoted the transcriptional activation of WW Domain Containing E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 2 ( WWP2 ) and WWP2 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of SH2B SH2B3 overexpression reversed the effects of MEF2A overexpression on microglia states , BMECs injury and BBB function . In summary , MEF2A promoted the ubiquitination mediated degradation of SH2B3 via transcription up regulating WWP2 , then changed the activation status of microglia , thus ameliorating BMEC injury , and finally ameliorating IS injury .
PsbR is a nonpigmented 10 kDa protein in Photosystem II ( PSII ) in algae and plants . A recent structural study clarified its enigmatic structural location in a Photosystem II megacomplex that has baffled the community for more than four decades . Our current study interrogates whether absence of PsbR affects the overall dynamics of excitation energy migration within light harvesting complexes ( LHC ) and PSII super assemblies using highly active PSII membrane particles , so called BBY particles , isolated from a PsbR deletion mutant ( DeltaPsbR ) of Arabidopsis thaliana . A femto second ( fs ) time resolved transient absorption experimentation recorded at 77 K with selective excitation of Chl b which is exclusively present in LHCs enabled us to resolve the temporal differences in LHC >LHC and LHC >PSII excitation energy transfer steps . By applying specific target spectro kinetic models to the transient absorption datasets , we demonstrated that the time constants of Chl a ( LHC ) > Chl a ( LHC ) excitation transfer significantly elongates in the DeltaPsbR LHC PSII particles , suggestive of the decreased aggregation level of photosynthetic proteins in the mutant . These findings highlight excitation energy transfer integrity in LHC PSII assembly is not only determined by the pigmented light harvesting complexes , but also synergistically by the nonpigmented PSII components . The disturbed integrity in dynamics of excitation energy transfer pathway within LHC PSII supercomplex is discussed in the context of the altered LHC PSII megacomplexes type I and II architectures which result from the absence of the PsbR protein in higher plant PSII .
PURPOSE : The influence of blood pressure on microvascular free flap perfusion is not fully understood and remains an ongoing topic of debate , as flap perfusion is both a prerequisite for flap viability and a parameter frequently used for postoperative flap monitoring . The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of blood pressure on microvascular free flap perfusion . METHODS : Perfusion measurement data obtained with the Oxygen 2 see ( O2C ) analysis system intraoperatively and postoperatively in 244 patients who underwent microvascular reconstruction of the head and neck region with a fasciocutaneous free flap ( FFF ) or perforator free flap ( PFF ) between 2011 and 2020 were analyzed retrospectively . Blood pressure values ( i . e . , systolic ( SBP ) , diastolic ( DBP ) , and mean arterial blood pressure ( MBP ) ) and perfusion parameters ( i . e . , flap blood flow , hemoglobin concentration , and hemoglobin oxygen saturation ) were evaluated to reveal potential associations . RESULTS : Postoperative flap blood flow was associated with SBP , DBP , and MBP in PFFs ( r = 245 , p = 006 ; r = 239 , p = 008 ; r = 295 , p < 001 , respectively ) . These associations also persisted in multivariable analysis ( p = 036 ; p = 024 ; p = 004 , respectively ) . Postoperative hemoglobin oxygen saturation was associated with SBP and MBP in PFFs ( r = 253 , p = 005 ; r = 189 , p = 036 , respectively ) . The association with SBP also persisted in multivariable analysis ( p = 005 ) . CONCLUSION : Microvascular free flap perfusion in PFFs , specifically postoperative flap blood flow and hemoglobin oxygen saturation , is influenced by blood pressure . This suggests that blood pressure might be an adjustable variable for the control of flap perfusion and should be considered as a confounding variable for flap monitoring based on flap perfusion in PFFs .
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer globally and the leading cause of cancer related deaths in women . Current treatments , such as chemotherapy and surgery , often have side effects and can lead to drug resistance . Developing new treatments that specifically target cancer cells while minimizing side effects is essential . Combining traditional cancer treatments with photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) is a promising approach . This study evaluated the effectiveness of femtosecond laser driven PDT using Doxorubicin ( DOX ) and tetrakis ( 1 methylpyridinium 4 yl ) porphyrin ( TMPyP ) , both individually and in combination , on MDA MB 231 and T47D breast cancer cells . TMPyP PDT and DOX monotherapy both exhibited dose dependent cytotoxicity . However , combination therapy was more effective at lower DOX concentrations , potentially reducing side effects . This combination also increased reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) levels , inhibited angiogenesis by reducing TGF beta and VEGFA expression , and induced apoptosis by decreasing BCL 2 and increasing BAX levels compared to individual treatments . These findings suggest that combining TMPyP mediated PDT with Doxorubicin could effectively inhibit breast cancer cell growth .
This study investigated the effects of hypoxic ischemic ( HI ) injury on neonatal neuroplasticity using the following approaches : Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( H MRS ) imaging to analyze dynamic changes in tau protein levels , immunofluorescence staining to evaluate synaptophysin ( SYP ) , neurocan ( Neu ) , and tau protein , and utilizing transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) to examine synaptic ultrastructure at multiple time points . A total of 59 healthy neonatal pigs were included , with 10 in the control group and 43 in the HI model group . The results demonstrated that SYP immunostaining intensity peaked at 6 12 h after HI before declining . Neu expression exhibited an initial decrease , followed by a transient increase and subsequent reduction , reaching its lowest level at 6 12 h after HI . Tau protein levels increased initially after HI , peaked at 24 48 h after HI , and subsequently decreased . SYP was negatively correlated with Neu with a correlation coefficient of SYP was not correlated with Tau , neither was Neu with Tau . Compared with the control group , the number of synaptic vesicles decreased , and Post Synaptic Density ( PSD ) thickness increased 6 12 h after HI . At 12 24 h after HI , the number of synaptic vesicles increased , and PSD thickness slightly decreased . At 24 48 h after HI , the vesicle number decreased , PSD became thinner , interrupting continuity , mitochondria swelled , and mitochondrial cristae blurred and disappeared . The findings suggest that the expression of Tau , SYP , and Neu is linked to alterations in synaptic and myelin structures , reflecting varying aspects of neural plasticity following HI injury .
The heart is an important factor affecting the upper limit of thermal tolerance in fish , and plays a major role in their physiological plasticity and acclimation to different thermal conditions . Turbot ( Scophthalmus maximus ( L . ) ) is a cold water marine fish , and in our previous studies , selecting a high temperature resistant strain ( HR ) which increased the upper limit of high temperature tolerance by more than 2 degrees C . The study evaluated the difference of the thermal tolerance between the high temperature resistant strain ( HR ) and general group ( GG ) by using Arrhenius break temperatures ( ABT ) . The ABT between them showed a significant difference that suggested different levels of thermal resistance . The result was consistent with assessments of upper thermal tolerance , as well as the activity of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase . Meanwhile , the key genes regulating cardiac performance were analyzed in molecular level . Quantitative real time PCR results demonstrated that the RNA expression of beta ARs in the heart at increasing temperature followed an upward trend . However , the expression of mmp2 , timp2 , fosa , and pcna genes in the heart decreased . Additionally , western blot results demonstrated that the levels of beta1 AR and beta3 AR protein expression steadily increased . Overall , in response to acute thermal stress , the primary effector genes in the beta AR signalling pathway were beta ARs . Our study identified an effective and accurate measurement for evaluating the turbot ' s thermal tolerance and initially explored the molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiac performance under thermal stress . These would be greatly beneficial in aquaculture and breeding projects of turbot .
Parthenocarpic fruit development in prickly pear involves up regulation of the transcription factor BZR1 and increased levels of brassinolide in developing ovules . We explored the complex process of parthenocarpic fruit development in prickly pear Opuntia ficus indica ( Cactaceae ) by comparing the fruits of the parthenocarpic Beer Sheva1 ( BS1 ) mutant and revertant non parthenocarpic fruits . The mutant plants produce flowers with enlarged ovules that develop into degenerated seed like stony structures . Pollen tubes fail to penetrate the ovule , resulting in the formation of lignified and hard seed coat brown in colour . Some new stems on BS1 plants bear normal revertant flowers containing small and viable fertilized ovules . BS1 thus provides a unique model for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying parthenocarpy in prickly pear . Our working hypothesis was that parthenocarpy is induced by elevated levels of brassinolide in the ovules of BS By comparing transcriptomes , we identified 7717 differentially expressed genes between BS1 and the revertant among them brassinosteroid related genes . Quantification of the brassinosteroids confirmed higher brassinolide levels and up regulation of the brassinosteroid positive regulator BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 ( BZR1 ) in BS1 ovules compared to revertant ovules displaying normal seed development . Thereby , implicating the involvement of brassinolide in ovule development , fruit phenology , and parthenocarpy . The early flowering and fruit ripening observed in BS1 support our hypothesis that brassinolide promotes parthenocarpic fruit development and ripening .
The Pacific oyster ( Crassostrea gigas ) , a species of significant economic importance in global aquaculture , faces increasing challenges due to climate change and salinity fluctuations in coastal environments . This study aims to explore the breeding potential of low salinity tolerance traits and dissect their genetic basis , thereby improving environmental adaptability and expanding aquaculture zones . A total of 845 oysters from 36 full families were exposed to a low salinity challenge ( 10 practical salinity units ) for assessing phenotypic variation , estimating genetic parameters , and dissecting the genetic basis of low salinity tolerance . The variation in survival rates among families ( 0 27% ) highlighted substantial phenotypic plasticity of low salinity tolerance . Heritability estimates for low salinity tolerance traits ranged from 141 to 277 , indicating low to moderate level genetic control of the trait . The low genetic and phenotypic correlations were observed between low salinity tolerance and growth traits . Using a high throughput and cost effective genotyping approach by low coverage whole genome sequencing with genotype imputation , we genotyped 297 samples with contrasted performance in low salinity tolerance and detected 3 , 830 , 446 high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) for genetic analysis . Genome wide association studies ( GWAS ) uncovered the polygenic architecture of low salinity tolerance and identified 16 SNPs associated with eight genes involved in oxidative metabolism , transmembrane transport , and immune defense . This study performed the first estimation of genetic parameters for low salinity tolerance in C . gigas and identified genetic markers and associated genes for the trait , providing valuable information toward genetic improvement of low salinity tolerance in the oyster using both traditional and genomic selection breeding strategies .
This study evaluated the effects of dietary enzyme treatment and fermentation on the performance , intestinal morphology , and nutrient digestibility of broilers fed canola meal at different inclusion levels during the finisher phase . A total of 900 male Hubbard broilers were assigned to diets containing untreated , enzyme treated , or fermented canola meal at 6% , 12% , and 18% inclusion levels . Results showed that enzyme and fermentation treatments significantly improved feed intake ( FI ) in the early growth phases , particularly at 6% and 12% inclusion , while higher inclusion ( 18% ) negatively impacted FI . Weight gain ( WG ) was significantly enhanced at lower canola levels , with enzyme treated and fermented groups outperforming untreated birds , particularly in the finisher phase . Feed conversion ratio ( FCR ) improved at 6% and 12% inclusion , while the 18% level resulted in lower efficiency . Fermentation significantly increased apparent metabolizable energy ( AME ) , with the highest values observed at 12% inclusion . Intestinal viscosity was reduced in fermented groups , while untreated and enzyme treated birds exhibited higher viscosity , particularly at 18% inclusion . Histomorphological analysis revealed increased villus height and surface area in fermented and enzyme treated birds . These findings indicate that 6% and 12% canola meal inclusion , combined with enzyme treatment or fermentation , optimizes broiler growth and nutrient utilization at finisher phase .
PURPOSE : Fish oil supplements and plasma fatty acid levels were reported to be associated with lung function . We aimed to investigate the association of fish oil supplements and plasma fatty acids with lung function . METHODS : We included 248 , 133 participants with complete data on relative index of plasma fatty acids from the UK Biobank . Linear regression models were used to investigate associations of fish oil supplements and plasma fatty acids with pulmonary function . Mediation analysis was performed to identify the potential mediating role of plasma fatty acid . All analyses were multivariable adjusted . RESULTS : Higher lung function was observed in fish oil users ( 59 ml for FEV1 and 92 ml for FVC ) . We found that each 1 unit increment of plasma PUFA , omega 3 , omega 6 , DHA , LA , and PUFA/MUFA were positively associated with lung function ( 74 ml , 15 ml , 81 ml , 23 ml , 44 ml , and 67 ml for FEV1 , respectively ; 04 ml , 39 ml 63 ml , 51 ml , 53 ml , and 02 ml for FVC , respectively ) , while SFA and MUFA were inversely associated with lung function ( 74 ml and 19 ml for FEV1 , respectively ; 44 ml and 83 ml for FVC , respectively ) . Omega 6/omega 3 only showed a negative association with FEV1 ( 17 ml ) . Mediation analysis suggested that plasma fatty acids partly mediated the associations between fish oil supplements intake and lung function , mainly DHA ( 70% and 50% for FEV1 and FVC , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS : We provided evidence that fish oil supplements and plasma fatty acids were both associated with lung function parameters , and the positive association between fish oil intake and lung function was mainly mediated by DHA .
Sporadic Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) involves specific neuronal types and progresses in a systematic manner , permitting subdivision into six neuropathological stages . Neurofibrillary tangle ( NFT ) stages I III display abnormal tau inclusions confined to subcortical nuclei and temporal allocortical regions , frequently without amyloid beta ( Abeta ) deposition . We previously suggested a sequence of neuronal involvement in AD that could proceed from entorhinal pre alpha cells to hippocampal prosubicular pyramidal cells and the CA1/CA2 sectors , from there to the thorny excrescences on mossy cells in CA3/CA4 , and , finally , from the mossy cells to dentate fascia ( Fd ) granular cells . Here , we aimed to see if associations existed between the early NFT stages I III , when Abeta deposits are frequently absent , and the following four categories : anatomical regions and abnormal morphological tau changes in region specific layers , nerve cell loss , APOE genotype , and the trajectory ( directionality ) of tau progression in the hippocampal formation . To do so , we examined the transentorhinal/entorhinal regions and hippocampal formation using AT8 immunohistochemistry in 100 microm sections from N = 308 brains with tau inclusions lacking Abeta deposits between NFT stages I and III ( average age at death 7 years for females , 4 years for males ) . Our results indicated a significantly ( p < 001 ) ordered progression of abnormal tau in a direction opposite to currently known unidirectional intrahippocampal connections , thereby indirectly supporting the idea of transneuronal abnormal tau spreading , i . e . , anterogradely , through the hippocampal formation . Tau related neuronal loss was also significant ( p < 001 for the transentorhinal/entorhinal regions and for sectors CA1/CA2 and p = 003 for CA3/CA4/Fd ) . These findings challenge the amyloid cascade and the PART hypotheses , corroborating the concept that early AD related tau inclusions and tau related neuronal loss occur independently of Abeta deposition .
PURPOSE : The aim of this study was to explore how sulforaphane ( SFN ) , a well known nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) pathway activator , regulates hepatic autophagy and apoptosis by modulating the polarization of Kupffer cells via the Nrf2/HO 1 pathway in a hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation ( HS/R ) model in mice . METHODS : Male c57/BL6 mice were subjected to hemorrhagic shock ( HS ) for 90 min under blood pressure control . Resuscitation was performed by reinfusing the withdrawn blood and infusing 9% NaCl , and SFN was administered intraperitoneally . All animals were euthanized 24 h after resuscitation , and liver tissue samples were collected for TUNEL staining , western blot analysis , immunohistochemical staining , immunofluorescence staining , and observation using transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging ( MALDI MSI ) was performed to verify the SFN distribution in the liver . RESULTS : SFN reached the liver within the first hour after it was injected . SFN was found to promote the hepatic Nrf2/HO 1 pathway and the polarization of Kupffer cells to the M2 phenotype rather than the M1 phenotype after HS/R . Furthermore , SFN inhibited hepatic apoptosis after HS/R , as demonstrated by a decrease in the Bax/Bcl 2 ratio , fewer TUNEL positive cells , and changes in cleaved caspase 3 expression . Enhanced hepatic autophagy was observed after HS/R , as shown by an increase in the number of autophagosomes , a higher LC3 II/LC3 I ratio , and decreased expression of p62 and beclin CONCLUSIONS : In this study , SFN administration inhibited hepatic apoptosis and promoted hepatic autophagy by inducing Kupffer cells to polarize to the M2 phenotype rather than the M1 phenotype via the Nrf2/HO 1 pathway .
BACKGROUND : Gestational hypertension ( GH ) and pre eclampsia ( PE ) are common high risk complications of pregnancy , and are also one of the important causes of global maternal mortality and perinatal mortality . It has been suggested that abnormal lipid metabolism may play a key role in the pathogenesis of GH and PE . However , the results of different studies are controversial and lack of systematic quantitative analysis . PURPOSE : The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in lipid levels between patients with GH and PE and healthy controls by meta analysis , and to explore the potential role of abnormal lipid metabolism in the disease . DESIGN : In this study , PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , CNKI , and other Chinese and English databases were searched . The subjects included in the study were patients with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy ( including GH and pre eclampsia ) and healthy controls . To evaluate the differences in triglyceride ( TG ) , total cholesterol ( TC ) , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , and low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) levels by systematic review and meta analysis . Revman software was used to calculate the standardized mean difference ( SMD ) and its 95% confidence interval ( CI ) . Heterogeneity was evaluated by I statistic and Q test . Publication bias and sensitivity analysis were also performed . RESULTS : A total of 5 studies were included in the meta analysis of gestational hypertension and lipid profile during pregnancy , including 321 patients with gestational hypertension and 1171 healthy pregnant women . A total of 7 studies were included in the meta analysis , including 1114 women with gestational hypertension and 32 , 537 healthy pregnant women . The results showed that HDL levels in patients with gestational hypertension were significantly lower than those in the control group ( SMD = 20 , 95% CI 35 to 06 , P = 006 ) , while LDL ( SMD = 40 , 95% CI 22 to 59 , P < 00001 ) , TC ( SMD = 37 , 95% CI 23 to 51 , P < 00001 ) , and TG ( SMD = 64 , 95% CI 50 to 79 , P < 00001 ) were significantly elevated . HDL levels were significantly lower in the pre eclampsia group than in the control group ( SMD = 30 mmol/L , 95% CI 36 , 11 , P < 00001 ) , while LDL ( SMD = 25 , 95% CI 18 , 31 , P < 00001 ) , TC ( SMD = 27 mmol/L , 95% CI 21 , 22 , P < 00001 ) and TG ( SMD = 15 , 9% CI 55 , 74 , P = 0002 ) were significantly increased . Heterogeneity analysis showed moderate to high heterogeneity in some indicators ( I range : 56 99% ) . No significant bias was found in the publication bias test , and the results were robust . CONCLUSION : This study suggests that abnormal lipid metabolism may be an important feature of GH and pre eclampsia , suggesting that dynamic monitoring of lipid levels has clinical value for early prediction and management of the disease . The decrease of HDL level may impair the vascular protective function , and the increase of LDL , TC , and TG levels may aggravate endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress , thereby affecting placental perfusion function .
Microbial biofilms are important components in macrophyte decomposition , and their composition depends on the decomposition stage and host plant quality . Here , we investigated how macrophyte tissue quality ( i . e . , C : N : P stoichiometry and phenolic contents ) influences epiphytic microbial biofilms during litter decomposition . Consecutive experiments were conducted to modify the C : N : P stoichiometry and phenolic content of the freshwater macrophyte Elodea nuttallii by manipulating light and nutrient availability and test how the modified tissue quality affected epiphytic microbial biofilm diversity and community composition before and during macrophyte decomposition . Our results showed that shading led to lower C : N ratios ( 6 to 6 ) and higher phenolic content ( 8 to 2 microg/mg dry weight ) . Simultaneously , shading affected the epiphytic bacterial and fungal community composition , and these shifts correlated with the macrophyte C : N ratio . While no effects of macrophyte tissue quality on decomposition rates were observed , the epiphytic bacterial community composition on the litter was significantly affected by light treatment , time , and their interaction . Bacterial community composition shifted from a high abundance of Comamonadaceae to a more diverse community over time . Overall bacterial diversity was lower on the litter grown in the shaded mesocosms . Fungal diversity and community composition during litter decomposition were not affected by litter quality . Overall , our results reveal a structuring role of macrophyte tissue quality on its associated microbial biofilm and uniquely show a continuation of light driven changes in epiphytic bacterial community composition after exposure . We conclude that light driven changes in C : N stoichiometry are a crucial factor in shaping epiphytic microbial communities during macrophyte decomposition .
Beauvericin ( BEA ) is an emerging mycotoxin with wide ranging bioactivity ( antimicrobial and insecticide ) , making it a potential target for drug and pesticide development . BEA primarily produced by Beauveria , Isaria , and Fusarium species . The BEA producing abilities of a collection of 100 Fusarium strains isolated from maize were tested using a gene specific primer ( Beas_1 , Beas_2 ) by PCR . Among all , 23 were found to have the beauvericin synthetase ( BEAS ) gene sequence , which is responsible for the production of BEA . Fusarium proliferatum and F . verticillioides strains were producing the highest BEA concentrations . The toxin producing ability of the strains was investigated in small bioreactors . Parallel with BEA , the most frequent Fusarium toxins such as deoxynivalenol ( DON ) , T2 , HT 2 , zearalenone ( ZEA ) , fumonisin B1 ( FB1 ) , and fumonisin B2 ( FB2 ) were also measured . Only FB1 and FB2 were observed above the detection limit , the coexistence of the FBs and BEA was measured in high concentration . In all BEA producing strains , the FBs production could be detected . The highest BEA concentration was 3131 mg/kg , and the highest FB1 and FB2 concentrations were 4393 mg/kg and 1390 mg/kg , respectively . In the present study , the gene sequences responsible for the production of BEA in F . verticilloides isolates have not only been detected but also demonstrated with UHPLC ESI MS/MS to be capable of biosynthesis . From the phylogenic analysis of the BEAS gene sequences , the assumption could be made that the ability to produce BEA was conferred via horizontal gene transfer .
Glioblastoma multiforme , one of the most malignant types of brain tumor , heavily relies on glycolytic pathways and is significantly influenced by immune infiltration and its surrounding microenvironment . Growing evidence implies that increase in glycolysis can lead to lactate accumulation , which further contributed to histone lactylation , playing a crucial role in tumor development , maintenance , and therapeutic response . This study explores the prognostic and therapeutic potential of lactylation related genes in glioblastoma multiforme . Using single cell ( GSE162631 ) and bulk transcriptome datasets ( TCGA , CGGA , and GSE16011 ) , we identified lactylation related genes through ssGSEA and WGCNA . Moreover , a machine learning framework , incorporating 10 algorithms and 101 combinations , was used to establish an eight gene lactylation related signature ( POLDIP3 , MMP14 , MDK , KDELR2 , GSTK1 , DEDD2 , CD151 , and BRI3 ) with robust predictive accuracy for patient survival . A nomogram with lactylation related signature integration was developed as a quantitative prognostic instrument for clinical use . Moreover , patients classified by lactylation related signature risk scores showed distinct immune status , tumor mutation burden , immunotherapy response , and drug sensitivity . The expression of those lactylation related genes was further validated by quantitative PCR and functional experiment in normal and GBM cell lines . Overall , this study establishes a lactylation related signature with significant potential for glioblastoma multiforme prognostic prediction , targeted prevention , and individualized therapy .
Aquatic ecosystems are seriously threatened by the uncontrolled release of untreated pharmaceutical effluent into water bodies . The current inquisition was devised to estimate the effect of untreated and vermifiltration treated pharmaceutical effluent in fish Channa punctata . A substantial decline in Hb , RBC count , and PCV values and escalation in WBC count , MCH , and MCHC values were recorded in untreated effluent unveiled group in contrast to control group after 15 , 30 , and 45 days of exposure . On contrasting the untreated and vermifiltration treated groups , the treated group demonstrated significantly ( p </= 05 ) higher Hb ( 12 +/ 1 to 14 +/ 07 ) , RBC count ( 67 +/ 11 to 51 +/ 12 ) , and PCV ( 42 +/ 48 to 45 +/ 55 ) following 45 days of exposure . However , reduction in WBC count , MCH and MCHC were noticed in treated group in contrast to untreated group . Substantially enhanced alterations in serum biochemical parameters ( glucose , total protein , AST , ALT , and ALP ) , oxidative stress marker ( MDA ) , and antioxidant enzyme activities ( SOD , CAT , and GST ) were also studied in untreated effluent group . Diminution alterations in antioxidant enzyme levels of fish unveiled to treated effluent implies less toxic nature of the vermifiltration treated effluent . Further , less ultrastructural and biomolecular anomalies were detected in treated effluent fish . The findings of the study showed that untreated pharmaceutical effluent wreaked toxicity potential on physiology of fish ; however , diminution in toxicity in vermifiltration treated group validated the efficacy of vermifiltration technology in treating pharmaceutical effluent .
Outer retinal function depends on two supporting tissues : the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) and the choroid . Limited molecular information is available on the intercellular networks that sustain RPE/choroid tissue in both healthy and pathological states . Galectin 1 ( Gal1 ) , a beta galactoside binding lectin , has recently emerged as a key regulator of angiogenesis and a potential therapeutic target in vascular pathologies , including age related macular degeneration . Here , we studied the expression of Gal1 in the outer retina and its regulatory role in the RPE/choroid under physiological and pathological conditions . Our findings indicate that Gal1 is predominantly associated with stromal cells in the RPE/choroid . In Gal1 deficient ( Lgals1 ( / ) ) mice , the RPE/choroid ultrastructure and gene expression profiles were altered , and choroidal explants exhibited reduced sprouting compared to those of wild type mice . Consistently , recombinant Gal1 promoted choroidal sprouting under hypoxic conditions , and stromal like cells modulated pro angiogenic and antiangiogenic gene expression in vitro under pathological conditions . Interestingly , Gal1 was also expressed by the RPE , with apical secretion under normoxia that shifted toward a basolateral phenotype under hypoxia . These findings identify stromal like cells and RPE as key sources of Gal1 in the choroid , highlighting its distinct roles in maintaining RPE/choroid homeostasis in healthy or pathological microenvironments .
This research investigated the protective properties of Carvacrol ( CVC ) against Isoproterenol ( ISO ) induced oxidative stress , neuroinflammation , and mitochondrial dysfunction in rats . The findings showed that CVC treatment did not significantly modify baseline oxidative stress levels in healthy rats but successfully alleviated ISO induced oxidative damage by augmenting antioxidant enzyme activity and diminishing lipid peroxidation , as demonstrated by a reduction in MDA levels . These findings indicate that CVC can reinstate antioxidant capability and reduce oxidative damage . Concerning neuroinflammation , ISO therapy markedly increased the expression of pro inflammatory markers , including TNF alpha , IL 1beta , c Fos , BDNF , Nfl , and GFP , signifying a robust inflammatory and damage response . The injection of CVC following ISO exposure markedly decreased the expression of these markers , suggesting that CVC may exert a neuroprotective effect by regulating the inflammatory response and mitigating neuronal and glial damage . CVC demonstrated a notable protective effect on mitochondrial integrity , evidenced by the decreased mRNA expression of mitochondrial damage markers , including NSE , s100B , CALP1 , and CALM1 in the CVC treated groups , showing that CVC mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction . The analysis revealed no significant alterations in the expression levels of Abeta40 , pTau181 , and tTau across all groups , indicating that these biomarkers were not substantially influenced by CVC treatment under the study ' s conditions . However , beta amyloid accumulation varied significantly between groups , highlighting the need for further research to explore CVC ' s potential implications in amyloid related diseases . These findings endorse CVC ' s neuroprotective efficacy and therapeutic potential in neurological disorders associated with oxidative stress , inflammation , and mitochondrial impairment .
OBJECTIVE : Overall , police officers have higher rates of several adverse health conditions ( e . g . , cardiovascular health profiles and post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) ) compared to persons in many other occupations . Our objective was to conduct a comparative study of occupational exposures and health outcomes among police officers across : ( a ) a 7 year period , from the baseline examination ( 2004 2009 ) to the 1st follow up examination ( 2011 2015 ) and ( b ) a 12 year period , from baseline to the 2nd follow up examination ( 2015 2019 ) . METHODS : Participants were from the Buffalo Cardio Metabolic Occupational Police Stress ( BCOPS ) Study . Variables were assessed through self report , standardized validated questionnaires , or standardized medical procedures . We computed the 7 and 12 year changes in mean values ( for continuous/numeric variables ) or prevalence ( for categorical variables ) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) using MIXED and GENMOD procedures in SAS . RESULTS : Occupational stress significantly increased over 12 years [4 ; ( 95% CI 2 , 6 ) ] . The percentage of officers who reported excellent/very good health significantly decreased across both time periods : [ 8% ; ( 8 , 9 ) ] across seven years and [ 3% ; ( 2 , 4 ) ] across 12 years . The prevalence of metabolic syndrome increased over seven years [7% ; ( 3 0 ) ] and over 12 years [4% ; ( 1 0 ) ] . Abdominal obesity and glucose intolerance significantly increased over both time periods while hypertension and elevated triglyceride levels increased slightly but not significantly over both time periods . CONCLUSION : Occupational stressors and some health outcomes of officers worsened over time indicating the need for self health monitoring and wellness programs for police .
Vascular repair and regeneration are critical for tissue homeostasis . Endothelial colony forming cells ( ECFCs ) are vessel resident progenitors with vasoreparative capacity and they offer an important avenue for allogeneic cytotherapy to achieve perfusion of ischemic tissues . Endothelial Protein C Receptor ( EPCR ) has been proposed as a marker for vascular endothelial stem cells , but its precise role in ECFC biology remains unknown . The current study has investigated the biological relevance of EPCR in ECFC function . Our data show that over 95% of ECFCs exhibit high EPCR expression . These levels surpassing CD34 and CD157 , positions EPCR as a new robust ECFC immunophenotypic marker , alongside established markers CD31 and CD Functionally , depleting EPCR expression in ECFCs significantly diminished angiogenic activity , including proliferation , migration and tube formation . This knockdown also altered normal ECFC barrier function . Transcriptomic analysis indicated that knockdown of EPCR led to enrichment of gene signatures for cell cycle , TGF beta , and focal adhesion kinases . G1 cell cycle arrest was confirmed in ECFCs with depleted EPCR . Mechanistically , EPCR knockdown led to increased release of TGFbeta2 and SMAD2/3 activation , coupled with increased p21 , decreased pFAK , and increased transgelin . Additionally , we showed that quiescent ECFCs showed significantly lower EPCR expression when compared to proliferating ECFCs . In agreement with this , cell sorting experiments demonstrated that ECFCs with the highest EPCR expression exhibited the highest clonogenic capacity . In summary , our findings highlight that EPCR expression in ECFCs is critical for their angiogenic activity , by modulating cell cycle progression .
BACKGROUND : Cancer cells employ various adaptive mechanisms to withstand stressors , with one notable pathway being the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) , crucial in fostering endocrine resistance within ER positive breast cancer . Investigating miRNAs within tumors holds promise for identifying key miRNA gene interactions pivotal for tumor characteristics like proliferation and resistance to treatment . Notably , XBP1 emerges as a pivotal player in UPR within the endoplasmic reticulum , particularly through the inositol requiring enzyme 1 ( IRE1alpha ) the X box binding protein 1 ( XBP1 ) pathway , presenting a compelling target for clinical intervention . In this study , I explore the regulatory role of miR 770 5p in modulating XBP1 expression and its potential as a therapeutic target in luminal breast cancer . METHODS AND RESULTS : The role of XBP1 in cancer cell pathogenesis has been investigated using bioinformatics tools to analyze its expression in breast cancer samples and its association with clinical outcomes . The relationship between miR 770 5p and XBP1 was further explored through bioinformatics analysis and ROC plot assessment . qRT PCR and bioinformatics data confirmed the negative correlation between miR 770 5p and XBP1 , particularly in Luminal A subtype with wild type p My results demonstrated that miR 770 5p targets XBP1 , inhibiting its spliced form and reducing its downstream transcriptional activity . Moreover , I found that miR 770 5p can modulate tamoxifen sensitivity by influencing the XBP1/ESR1 axis in breast cancer cells . Overexpression of miR 770 5p led to decreased ESR1 levels , enhancing tamoxifen efficacy and suggesting a potential novel therapeutic approach for luminal subtype breast cancer . CONCLUSIONS : miR 770 5p has a growth inhibitory function in luminal breast cancer , where its suppression of XBP1 contributes to the increased sensitivity to tamoxifen .
INTRODUCTION : Bile acid diarrhea ( BAD ) is a socially debilitating disease characterized by diarrhea , fecal urgency , and fecal incontinence . It is caused by excessive amounts of bile acids in the colon and is estimated to affect up to 1% of the population . Among other actions , bile acids regulate systemic glucose and lipid metabolism , and BAD has been associated with a dysmetabolic prediabetic like state . Here , we investigate the association between BAD and type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , respectively . METHODS : By using nationwide Danish health registries , individuals with BAD were identified by referral to the diagnostic 75selenium homotaurocholic acid test followed by redemption of a prescription of a bile acid sequestrant within 365 days or a BAD diagnosis code ( n=5 , 954 ) . A reference population of age and sex matched individuals was included for comparison ( n=59 , 540 ) . RESULTS : More individuals with BAD than controls developed T2D ( 8% vs . 2% ) and experienced CVD ( 7% vs . 0% ) after index date ( i . e . , BAD diagnosis or matching , respectively ) . Sensitivity analyses revealed earlier onset of T2D and CVD in the BAD population compared with matches but no difference between sexes . The cause specific hazards for T2D and CVD were 79 and 34 , respectively , in the BAD population compared with matches . All cause mortality but not CVD related mortality was increased among individuals with BAD compared with matches . DISCUSSION : BAD is associated with increased risk and earlier onset of T2D and CVD , respectively , as well as disturbed glucose and lipid metabolism , indicating BAD as a high risk condition requiring intensified monitoring and relevant preventive interventions .
BACKGROUND : Severe bleeding is a leading cause of ICU admission and mortality . Fibrinogen plays a crucial role in prognosis , yet optimal thresholds and supplementation targets remain unclear . METHOD : Patients with major bleeding were extracted from the MIMIC IV database . Restricted cubic splines ( RCS ) identified the optimal pre treatment fibrinogen threshold , and propensity score matching adjusted for confounders . Multiple analytical methods , including multivariable regression and machine learning models , were applied . Post treatment fibrinogen levels were stratified based on guideline recommendations , and Cox regression assessed survival outcomes . RESULTS : Among 7 , 063 patients ( 6 , 666 survivors , 397 non survivors ) , RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship between pre treatment fibrinogen and ICU mortality ( P non linear < 001 ) , with a threshold at 3 g/L . Patients with Fib > 3 g/L had a significant 28 day survival benefit ( OR = 65 , 95% CI : 48 87 , p < 01 ) . Post treatment stratification showed that fibrinogen >/= 3 g/L was associated with improved survival ( p < 01 ) . RCS analysis identified an optimal post treatment target of 0 5 g/L . CONCLUSION : Fibrinogen levels are predictive of ICU outcomes in massive hemorrhage . A pre treatment threshold of 3 g/L indicates poor prognosis , while post treatment levels of 0 5 g/L may optimize survival .
The rising prevalence of electronic cigarettes ( E cigs ) use during pregnancy and lactation can be attributed , in part , to advertising campaigns promoting their safety . Nevertheless , the integrity of E cigs as a secure substitute for conventional cigarettes necessitates further exploration . Some studies emphasize the toxic role of nicotine in E cigs , while others underscore the significance of other distinct components whose toxicity cannot be disregarded . Increasingly , researchers are employing rodent models to elucidate the potential toxicological implications of e cig use . Various paradigms of E cigs exposure in early life frequently yield divergent health outcomes for offspring . This review first presents different animal model approaches to E cig exposure during pregnancy and lactation , referring to E cig liquid , E cig devices , puff topography , and inhalation methods , which would be related to the health outcomes . Moreover , the mechanisms underlying the hazardous impacts of maternal E cig exposure on offspring are also elucidated . Maternal exposure to E cigs has been found to induce adverse effects on lung function , neurobehavior , glycolipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in offspring , which are probably mediated through inflammation , oxidative stress , and epigenetic modifications .

Surgically castrated male pigs , which are commonly produced in pork production systems , have slightly lower production efficiency , compared to intact female pigs ( gilts ) . This is mainly due to an unfavorable feed conversion rate and fatter carcasses . These differences influenced by physiological and genetic factors can be identified through metabolomics , which describes metabolic profiles . In this study , we used untargeted metabolomics to analyze the plasma of 694 Italian Large White pigs ( 228 castrated males and 466 intact gilts ) , sampled at slaughter . The metabolomic profiles included 731 metabolites covering 98 sub pathways . The raw metabolomic data were cleaned and imputed using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations . The Boruta algorithm was then employed to identify metabolites that have different concentrations between castrated males and intact gilts . To address the random nature of feature selection , multiple Boruta runs were generated , nested within a 10 fold cross validation , resulting in 1 , 250 Boruta datasets . These datasets helped identify 40 informative metabolites , with a reduced core of 15 metabolites consistently confirmed across all runs . Their calculated random forest Out Of Bag ( OOB ) error was 25 and 27 , respectively . The relevance , ranking and predictive ability of each selected metabolite were determined based on the Mean Decrease Gini ( MDG ) and the area under the curve ( AUC ) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis , with MDG values of 024+/ 007 and 030+/ 009 and AUC values of 62+/ 04 and 65+/ 03 for the two metabolite sets , respectively . Of the 40 selected metabolites , 60% had higher concentrations in castrated males than in intact gilts , while in the 15 metabolites set , this percentage was 80% . Network and biological pathways analyses indicated that the selected metabolites were primarily amino acids and lipids , many of which belonged to their respective sub pathways , suggesting minimal biological differences between castrated males and intact gilts . These findings support previous results obtained using a targeted metabolomic platform . This study represents the largest investigation to date on the pig sex metabolome , providing essential biological insights that could inform precise husbandry and feeding strategies in pigs , taking into consideration the castration status of the males .
BACKGROUND : Retroperitoneal liposarcoma ( RPLS ) is a critical malignant disease with various clinical outcomes . However , the molecular heterogeneity of RPLS was poorly elucidated , and few biomarkers were proposed to monitor its progression . METHODS : RNA sequencing was performed on a training cohort of 88 RPLS patients to identify dysregulated genes and pathways using clusterProfiler . The GSVA algorithm was utilized to assess signaling pathway levels in each sample , and unsupervised clustering was employed to distinguish RPLS subtypes . Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) between RPLS subtypes were identified to construct a simplified dichotomous clustering via nonnegative matrix factorization . The feasibility of this classification was validated in a separate validation cohort ( n=241 ) using immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) from the REtroperitoneal SArcoma Registry ( RESAR ) . The study is registered with https : //clinicaltrials . gov/ under number NCT RESULTS : Cell cycle , DNA damage and repair , and metabolism were identified as the most aberrant biological processes in RPLS , enabling the division of RPLS patients into two distinct subtypes with unique molecular signatures , tumor microenvironment , clinical features , and outcomes ( overall survival [OS] and disease free survival [DFS] ) . A simplified RPLS classification based on representative biomarkers ( LEP and PTTG1 ) demonstrated high accuracy ( area under the curve [AUC]>99 ) , with patients classified as LEP+ and PTTG1 , showing lower aggressive pathological composition ratio and fewer surgery times , along with better OS ( HR = 41 , p<001 ) and DFS ( HR = 60 , p=005 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Our study provided an ever largest gene expression landscape of RPLS and established an IHC based molecular classification that was clinically relevant and cost effective for guiding treatment decisions .

Lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1 ( LCLAT1 ) is a lipid acyltransferase that plays an important role in mitochondrial function maintenance and lipid metabolism . Nevertheless , there is scarce research regarding its involvement in tumors . This study sought to investigate the potential role of LCLAT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . We obtained HCC expression profile data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases ; verified LCLAT1 expression in HCC by qRT PCR , Western blotting , and immunohistochemical ( IHC ) staining ; and analyzed the potential pathogenic mechanisms of LCLAT1 in HCC bioinformatically . The associations of the LCLAT1 expression level with HCC patient prognosis , immune escape , and treatment response were also explored using bioinformatics tools and IHC staining . LCLAT1 was significantly overexpressed in HCC cell lines and tissues , and its expression level was positively correlated with histologic grade , tumor status , fibrotic Ishak score , and poor patient prognosis in HCC patients . Gene set enrichment analysis suggested that patients with high LCLAT1 had significant enrichment for methylation , immune , and cell proliferation related pathways . The prognosis of HCC was found to be linked to the DNA methylation status of the five CpG islands within the LCLAT1 gene . Immune infiltration and single cell level analyses showed that LCLAT1 was closely associated with the tumor microenvironment . Moreover , high LCLAT1 expression may promote immune evasion in HCC , and the abundance of several immune cells correlated with HCC prognosis . Finally , HCC patients with low LCLAT1 responded better to treatment with transarterial chemoembolization , sorafenib , and immune checkpoint inhibitors . LCLAT1 might serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and as a multipathway target involved in the malignant progression of HCC . Importantly , LCLAT1 was related to immune infiltration and could aid in predicting treatment response in HCC .
This study aimed to evaluate the mechanisms involved in skeletal muscle lipotoxicity , impaired lipid metabolism , and oxidative stress induced by a sucrose rich diet ( SRD ) that mimics human Metabolic Syndrome ( MS ) , and to assess the preventive effects and molecular mechanisms of astaxanthin ( AXT ) extracted from freshwater crabs ( Dilocarcinus pagei ) on these alterations . Male Wistar rats received a reference diet ( RD ) , RD + AXT , SRD , or SRD + AXT ( 10 mg kg ( 1 ) day ( 1 ) orally ) for 90 days . Serum glucose , triglycerides , and cholesterol were measured . In skeletal muscle , triglyceride content , activities of lipogenic enzymes [fatty acid synthase ( FAS ) , acetyl CoA carboxylase ( ACC ) , malic enzyme ( ME ) , glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase ( G 6 PDH ) ] and mitochondrial beta oxidation enzyme [carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 ( CPT 1 ) ] were assessed , along with the expression of transcription factors sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c ( SREBP 1c ) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha ( PPARalpha ) by qPCR . Oxidative stress was evaluated by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , glutathione ( GSH ) , and antioxidant enzymes ( CAT , GPx , GR ) , as well as pNFkappaB p65 and NrF2 protein levels . SRD feeding induced dyslipidemia , intramuscular triglyceride accumulation , increased de novo lipogenesis and SREBP 1c expression , and reduced CPT 1 activity and PPARalpha expression in skeletal muscle . Oxidative stress was evidenced by elevated ROS and decreased GSH and antioxidant enzyme activities , with reduced NrF2 and increased pNFkappaB p65 levels . AXT supplementation attenuated these alterations by downregulating lipogenic enzymes and SREBP 1c , enhancing CPT 1 and PPARalpha expression , and modulating NrF2 and pNFkappaB p65 , thus improving lipid metabolism and redox balance in skeletal muscle . This study revealed new aspects of skeletal muscle lipid accumulation , lipid metabolism , and oxidative stress in SRD fed rats . We demonstrated the novel properties and molecular mechanisms of AXT extracted from freshwater crabs on these parameters in the skeletal muscle of an experimental model of MS .

Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is closely associated with atrial electrical and structural remodelling , yet effective drug strategies remain limited . Matrine ( MAT ) , the active compound in Sophora flavescens , has shown anti AF effects , but its mechanisms are unclear . This study explored MAT ' s impact on pressure overload induced AF using clinical samples , bioinformatics , network pharmacology and murine models , focusing on the canonical Wnt signalling . A murine pressure overload model was established via transverse aortic constriction ( TAC ) surgery for 4 weeks . Programmed electrical stimulation , langendorff perfusion , echocardiography , Masson ' s trichrome staining and western blotting were used to evaluate the potential effects and mechanisms of MAT . The results demonstrated that TAC induced atrial electrical and structural remodelling significantly increased susceptibility to AF in mice while also up regulated atrial Wnt3a/beta catenin signalling as well as markers for remodelling and inflammation , which were partially supported by clinical samples . MAT dose dependently mitigated atrial structural and electrical remodelling . Furthermore , MAT intervention inhibited Wnt3a/beta catenin signalling . However , co administration of SKL2001 , a Wnt/beta catenin agonist , counteracted MAT ' s benefits . The overall findings suggest that MAT treatment may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for inhibiting TAC induced atrial electrical and structural remodelling by suppressing Wnt3a/beta catenin signalling pathways , thereby reducing susceptibility to AF .
Assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) such as in vitro embryo culture ( IVC ) , is widely used in human infertility treatments ; however , its long term effects on the cardiac health of offspring remain unclear . This study aimed to determine whether the effects of IVC on cardiac metabolism and associated signaling pathways persist after birth into adolescence . Embryos were either transferred to an intermediate ewe ( ET ) or cultured in vitro in the absence ( IVC ) or presence of human serum ( IVCHS ) with methionine supplementation ( IVCHS+M ) for 6 days after mating . Naturally mated ( NM ) ewes were used as controls . Protein expression and hormone concentrations in the left ventricle ( LV ) were analyzed using Western blot and LC MS/MS analyses , respectively . IVC was associated with sex specific alterations in cardiac mitochondria , with males exhibiting reduced mitochondrial abundance . Cardiac protein expression of oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) complexes 1 and 4 was reduced by IVC . Additionally , IVC reduced protein expression of PDK 4 and Mn SOD in the IVCHS+M group , which may impact energy efficiency and defense against oxidative stress . These changes may predispose IVC offspring to cardiac oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction , particularly in males . This study provides insights into the sex dependent effects of IVC on cardiac health , emphasizing the importance of evaluating long term cardiovascular risks associated with IVC protocols .

Non Saccharomyces yeast species are increasingly used in winemaking in combination with Saccharomyces cerevisiae to modulate sensory attributes or as processing aids . Consequently , there is academic and practical interest in understanding how different yeast species interact with each other in grape must . Although interactions will depend on the metabolic capabilities of the strains involved , there are other possible interaction mechanisms between wine yeasts . In this work we used extracellular vesicle ( EV ) enriched fractions from different non Saccharomyces species to challenge S . cerevisiae inoculated in synthetic grape must . The results show that the previously described response to EVs of Metschnikowia pulcherrima was not an isolated phenomenon , but that S . cerevisiae responds in a general way to EVs of other yeast species . Meta analysis of the results points to protein biosynthesis and carbon catabolite repression as general targets ; both being stimulated by the interaction , beyond the acclimatisation to the synthetic juice experienced by the control cells . The intensity of the response showed differences between the four species ; while the transcriptional response to M . pulcherrima EVs clearly diverges from that to EVs of the other yeast species , which show greater similarity to each other .
BACKGROUND : Pulmonary tuberculosis ( TB ) frequently leads to long term lung complications that contribute to increased mortality . Understanding the pathogenesis of post TB lung impairments is crucial for improving long term outcomes in TB patients ; yet this area remains poorly researched . METHODS : Our study assessed circulatory inflammatory markers in patients who completed TB treatment more than one year before enrolment ( population 1 ) and patients receiving in hospital treatment for active drug sensitive TB ( population 2 ) . RESULTS : IL 6 was seven times higher in both populations compared to the normal range . IL 8 was below the limit of detection ( LOD ) in population 1 , while it was approximately 5 times higher in population 2 compared to the normal range . TNF alpha was 21 times higher in population 1 and 19 times higher in population 2 compared to the normal range . CRP was almost 49 times higher in both populations , and IL 1Ra was below the LOD in population 1 , while it was ~5 times higher in population 2 compared to the normal range . CONCLUSIONS : These inflammatory biomarkers correlated well with lung function in the post TB state , and their high levels suggest a persistent pro inflammatory state post TB , which may contribute to post TB lung disease . More research is warranted to better understand this phenomenon , but these findings may highlight a need to consider anti inflammatory therapy for patients with post TB lung disease , especially since these high levels of cytokines can directly contribute to lung damage .

Waldenstrom Macroglobulinaemia ( WM ) is sometimes difficult to differentiate from marginal zone lymphoma ( MZL ) , two entities with overlapping features for which no single marker assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry ( MFC ) is specific . The aim of this work was to establish a diagnostic phenotypic score for bone marrow ( BM ) and peripheral blood ( PB ) WM samples , to differentiate it from MZL and to improve the detection of small circulating WM clones . This study revealed a distinct phenotypic profile between WM and MZL B cells . WM B cells showed decreased expression of CD19 , FMC7 , CD22 , CD27 and increased expression of CD79b and CD Supervised and unsupervised MFC analyses were used to define a phenotypic scoring system : a score of 3/6 or greater in BM or 4/7 or greater in PB samples supported the diagnosis of WM ( sensitivity of 9% and 1% and specificity of 0% and 5% , respectively ) . These results were validated in a prospective cohort with very high sensitivity and specificity for the two scoring systems . Clinico biological correlations showed that the absence or low expression of CD38 on BM WM B cells was significantly associated with increased BM and PB infiltration ( p < 0001 and p = 0024 respectively ) and CXCR4 mutation ( p < 0001 ) . These results demonstrate that MFC can be used to differentiate WM from MZL with a scoring system that can be easily implemented in routine practice .
Background and Clinical Significance : Post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) is a severe complication of solid organ transplantation , often associated with prolonged immunosuppression . Diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) is the most common subtype . Managing PTLD requires a balance between reducing immunosuppression and preventing graft rejection . Case Presentation : A 41 year old female kidney transplant recipient developed PTLD eight years post transplant , presenting with a right submandibular mass . Biopsy confirmed CD20 positive DLBCL . Initial treatment involved reducing immunosuppression and rituximab monotherapy , which failed to prevent disease progression . The patient underwent six cycles of R CHOP chemotherapy , achieving complete metabolic remission . Relapse occurred twice , with disease progression in the cervical nodes and tonsils . Salvage therapies , including polatuzumab vedotin and rituximab , achieved remission . During a subsequent relapse , loncastuximab tesirine induced metabolic resolution . Compromised renal function limited treatment options and a second renal transplant was delayed , reducing the risk of PTLD recurrence . Conclusions : This case underscores the challenges of managing PTLD in transplant recipients , especially in relapsed/refractory cases . Single agent rituximab was insufficient , but combination chemotherapy and novel agents like loncastuximab tesirine were effective . Balancing oncologic control and graft preservation remains critical . This case highlights the need for individualized approaches and novel therapies in managing PTLD while addressing the complexities of immunosuppression and organ preservation . FAU Alshemmari , Salem
Neurocysticercosis ( NCC ) , a parasitic infection caused by Taenia solium larvae , remains a leading cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide , particularly in regions with inadequate sanitation and healthcare access . We present a case of NCC reactivation in a 64 year old female who developed anomic aphasia a rare manifestation of NCC decades after her initial diagnosis . The patient ' s clinical course was complicated by a potential trigger of semaglutide , which potentially attenuated the protective inflammatory response maintained by astrocytes and microglia , leading to the reactivation of dormant cysts . Brain imaging confirmed localized cystic changes , and treatment with antiparasitic agents and corticosteroids led to marked clinical improvement . This case highlights the complexity of NCC reactivation , highlighting the interplay of metabolic , immune , and parasitic factors . It emphasizes the need for vigilance in managing patients with dormant infections and investigating potential risks associated with novel therapeutic agents like GLP 1 receptor agonists . Further research is essential to unravel the mechanisms linking metabolic modulation to parasitic reactivation , offering insights into prevention and treatment strategies .

Adipocyte differentiation is a complex process in which pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) differentiate and develop into mature fat cells , also known as adipocytes . This process is controlled by various transcription factors , hormones , and signaling molecules that regulate the development of these cells . Recently , an increasing number of non coding RNAs ( ncRNAs ) , especially microRNAs ( miRNAs ) , have been established to be involved in the regulation of many biological processes , including adipocyte differentiation , development , metabolism , and energy homeostasis of white and brown adipose tissue . Several in vitro and in vivo studies reported the significant role of ncRNAs in either promoting or inhibiting adipocyte differentiation into white or brown fat cells by targeting specific transcription factors and regulating the expression of key adipogenic genes . Identifying the function of ncRNAs and their subsequent targets contributes to our understanding of how these molecules can be used as potential biomarkers and tools for therapies against obesity , diabetes , and other diseases related to obesity . This could also contribute to advancements in tissue engineering based treatments . In this review , we intended to present an up to date comprehensive literature overview of the role of ncRNAs , including miRNAs , long non coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) , and circular RNAs ( circRNAs ) , focusing particularly on miRNAs , in regulating the differentiation and development of cells into white and brown adipose tissue . In addition , we further discuss the potential use of these molecules as biomarkers for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for future personalized treatment options for patients .

INTRODUCTION : The psychosocial impact of living with an Inherited Metabolic Disorder ( IMD ) is becoming increasingly relevant and can have a significant impact on planning the future , conditioning the reproductive decisions made during adolescence and young adulthood . The aim of this paper is to explore thoughts about partner choices , parenthood and pregnancy among adolescents and young adults affected by IMDs . METHODS : A cross sectional study was performed . A sample of 23 patients affected by a range of IMDs were interviewed . Twenty two questions were provided , distinguished into four main themes : partners , parenthood , pregnancy and need for information . RESULTS : More than half of participants ( 57% ) reported insecurities about relationships and declared that they were single for this reason , with most ( 70% ) having a hope of having children in the future , although with the awareness and fear that they could also be affected . Almost all females ( 90% ) consider themselves able to carry a pregnancy in a way similar to other women . There was the common need for more information about their potential fertility and parenthood linked to their condition . CONCLUSION : Being diagnosed with an IMD can influence personal decisions regarding relationships and reproduction . The early identification of issues in these domains may enhance referrals for personalized interventions and build more focused support programmes . FAU Tummolo , Albina
Background : Morbidity and mortality rates in intensive care units ( ICUs ) reflect the severe health challenges faced by critically ill patients . Nutritional and immune status , as measured by the prognostic nutritional index ( PNI ) , are increasingly recognized as important predictors of intensive care unit outcomes . Objective : We aimed to compare the prognostic nutritional index levels of survived and deceased subjects treated in intensive care units . Methods : This retrospective study examined the association between prognostic nutritional index and mortality among intensive care unit patients treated from June 2023 to June The prognostic nutritional index was calculated using serum albumin and lymphocyte levels , and patients were categorized into survived and deceased groups . Statistical analyses , including ROC and logistic regression , were used to evaluate prognostic nutritional index ' s predictive capacity . Results : We revealed that deceased patients had significantly lower prognostic nutritional index values , lower platelet counts , and higher C reactive protein ( CRP ) and serum creatinine levels compared to survivors . The prognostic nutritional index was independently associated with mortality , with each unit increase decreasing mortality risk by 6% . Conclusion : These findings highlight the prognostic nutritional index ' s utility as a prognostic tool in intensive care unit settings , underscoring the need for nutritional assessments and targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes . Further research with larger cohorts is warranted to validate these findings and explore causative mechanisms . FAU Karagoz , Ibrahim
Introduction : Placebo controlled studies are crucial in clinical trials , but the placebo effect can vary across conditions . We aimed to assess the placebo effect in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) trials . Methods : We conducted a systematic review and included randomized placebo controlled trials investigating CTEPH interventions . Primary outcomes were the pre post changes in the 6 min walk test ( 6MWT ) and quality of life in the placebo arms . Secondary outcomes included mean pulmonary artery pressure ( mPAP ) , pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) , cardiac index , and NT proBNP levels . Meta analyses were performed using random effects models . Results : Seven trials with 270 CTEPH patients in placebo arms were analyzed . The average 6MWT change was not significant ( 31 m ; 95%CI 49 to +79 ) . Quality of life with EQ 5D was not significantly improved ( 04 ; 95%CI 10 to +02 ) . mPAP , PVR , cardiac index , and NT proBNP also demonstrated non significant changes with small magnitudes . Conclusions : The placebo effect in CTEPH trials was not statistically significant and had small magnitude but should not discourage the use of placebo controlled trials where applicable and ethical .

Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide . Despite the available treatment options , a majority of cancer patients develop drug resistance , indicating the need for alternative approaches . Repurposed drugs , such as antiglycolytic and anti microbial agents , have gained substantial attention as potential alternative strategies against different disease pathophysiologies , including lung cancer . To that end , multiple studies have suggested that the antiglycolytic dichloroacetate ( DCA ) and the antibiotic salinomycin ( SAL ) possess promising anticarcinogenic activity , attributed to their abilities to target the key metabolic enzymes , ion transport , and oncogenic signaling pathways involved in regulating cancer cell behavior , including cell survival and proliferation . We used the following searches and selection criteria . Biosis and PubMed were used with the search terms dichloroacetate ; salinomycin ; dichloroacetate as an anticancer agent ; salinomycin as an anticancer agent ; dichloroacetate side effects ; salinomycin side effects ; salinomycin combination therapy ; dichloroacetate combination therapy ; and dichloroacetate or salinomycin in combination with other agents , including chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors . The exclusion criteria included not being related to the mechanisms of DCA and SAL or not focusing on their anticancer properties . All the literature was sourced from peer reviewed journals within a timeframe of 1989 to Importantly , experimental studies have demonstrated that both DCA and SAL exert promising anticarcinogenic properties , as well as having synergistic effects in combination with other therapeutic agents , against multiple cancer models . The goal of this review is to highlight the mechanistic workings and efficacy of DCA and SAL as monotherapies , and their combination with other therapeutic agents in various cancer models , with a major emphasis on non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treatment .

Phthalates , a group of synthetic non persistent organic chemicals commonly used as solvents and plasticisers , have been associated with a range of detrimental health effects . These endocrine disrupting chemicals ( ECDs ) may exert their effects through epigenetic changes such as altered microRNA ( miRNA ) expression . miRNAs are short non coding endogenous RNA transcripts that are preferentially expressed in various tissues and cell types and can circulate in body fluids , thereby regulating gene expression and acting as mediators for intercellular communication . As miRNAs mostly target protein coding transcripts , they are involved in nearly all networks that regulate developmental and pathological processes . In this review , we provide an overview of human , in vivo and in vitro studies assessing altered miRNA expression due to phthalate exposure and their biological effects . Importantly , this study suggests that the mechanism of phthalate action may in part be mediated by epigenetic changes , affecting a large number of different proteins . This is indicative that alterations in miRNA expression induced by phthalate exposure are then implicated in a wide range of health conditions , including reproductive dysfunction , oncogenesis , metabolic disorders , and neurodevelopmental outcomes . Exposure to phthalates and their metabolites predominantly results in the upregulation of miRNAs . Dysregulation of miR 34a , miR 15b , miR 141 , miR 184 , miR 19a , miR 125 , and miR let 7 were observed across several studies . More research involving human participants combined with mechanistic studies integrating mRNA target analysis would be beneficial in understanding the downstream effects of phthalate exposure on gene expression and grasping the broader biological implications .

The excessive intake of monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) increases its cellular levels in different organs and induces organ toxicity . The current study aims to investigate the metabolic changes and possible causes of hepatic , renal , and cardiac toxicity induced by MSG overconsumption . Thirty adult male rats were randomly allocated into five groups : control , MSG8 , MSG1 , MSG2 , and MSG3 , which were orally treated with a daily oral dose of saline , 8 , 1 , 2 , and 3 g MSG/kg BW , respectively , for eight weeks . The hepatic , renal , and cardiac biochemical markers ; lipid profile ; glucose ; electrolytes ; iNOS ; alpha KGD ; oxidative stress ; and inflammatory markers were investigated . The histopathological examination of hepatic and renal tissues was also performed . The results revealed MSG induced hepato renal and cardiac toxicity , as indicated by the changes in the biochemical markers and tissue architecture of these organs . The toxicity is observed in the form of dyslipidemia , oxidative stress ( increased MDA and NO and decreased GSH , SOD , CAT , and GST ) , and inflammatory responses ( increased TNF alpha and IL 6 ) . The histopathological changes in liver and kidney architecture confirmed the obtained results . In conclusion , the MSG induced hepatic , renal , and cardiac toxicity was dose dependent , and awareness should be raised about the side effects of the overconsumption of MSG . FAU Abdou , Heba M
Decades of technological advancements have led to major environmental concerns , particularly the bioaccumulation of heavy metals , which pose persistent risks to ecosystems and human health . Consequently , research has increasingly shifted from conventional remediation techniques toward more sustainable , environmentally friendly solutions . This review explores recent advancements , ongoing challenges , and future perspectives in the field of bioremediation , emphasizing its potential as a green technology for heavy metal decontamination . Despite significant progress , key challenges remain , including scalability limitations and the management of bioremediation by products , along with the influence of regulatory policies and public perception on its large scale implementation . Emerging approaches such as genetic engineering and nanotechnology show promise in overcoming these limitations . Gene editing allows the tailoring of specific metabolic traits for bioprocesses targeted towards increased tolerance to pollutants and higher biodegradation efficiency , higher enzymatic specificity and affinity , and improved yield and fitness in plants . Nanotechnologies , particularly biogenic nanostructures , open up the possibility of repurposing waste materials as well as harnessing the advantages of the biosynthesis of NPs with higher stability , biocompatibility , and biostimulant capacities . Furthermore , biopolymers and bio based nanocomposites can improve the efficiency and costs of bioremediation protocols . Even so , further research is essential to evaluate their long term risks and feasibility . FAU Firinca , Cristina
Altered body condition and diminished growth in wildlife in the Alberta Oil Sands Region ( AOSR ) are prompting investigations into the impact of oil sands industrial activity on wildlife in the region . Chemical constituents from bitumen influenced waters , including oil sands process affected water ( OSPW ) , can disrupt endocrine signaling , leading to aberrant lipid accumulation and altered glycemic control in mammals . This study aimed to investigate the effects of naphthenic acid fraction components ( NAFCs ) , derived from OSPW , on energy homeostasis using the McA RH7777 rat hepatocyte model . Cells were exposed to NAFCs at nominal concentrations of 0 , 73 , 7 , and 4 mg/L for 24 and 48 h . We assessed gene expression related to lipid and glucose metabolism and measured triglyceride accumulation , glucose , and fatty acid uptake . NAFC exposure ( 7 and 4 mg/L ) reduced triglyceride levels and glucose uptake and increased fatty acid uptake and the expression of beta oxidation genes , suggesting a metabolic switch from glucose to fatty acid oxidation . This switch in substrate availability signifies a shift in cellular energy dynamics , potentially linked to altered mitochondrial function . To investigate this , we conducted adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , mitochondrial membrane potential , and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) assays to measure cellular ATP levels , mitochondrial membrane potential , and apoptosis , respectively . At both time points , 4 mg/L NAFC exposure resulted in increased ATP levels , induced mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization , and increased apoptosis . These results suggest that mitochondrial efficiency is compromised , necessitating metabolic adaptations to maintain energy homeostasis . Given that cells exhibit metabolic flexibility that allows them to dynamically respond to changes in substrate availability , we further demonstrated that the kynurenine tryptophan ratio ( KTR ) serves as a marker for a shift in energy metabolism under these stress conditions . This work provides a mechanistic framework for understanding how bitumen derived organic contaminants may disrupt metabolic function in wildlife living in the AOSR . These findings further support the use of molecular markers like KTR to evaluate sub lethal metabolic stress in environmental health monitoring . FAU Jamshed , Laiba
Congenital hypothyroidism ( CH ) is a critical condition in infancy where early detection is vital for optimal development . This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of Aotearoa New Zealand ' s Newborn Metabolic Screening " Low Birth Weight " protocol for detecting CH in preterm infants . A 10 year audit was conducted on 2935 preterm infants ( <2000 g or </=34 weeks gestation ) screened within NICUs or SCBUs in the Auckland region . The study assessed both screen detected and clinically detected cases of CH . Data were collected from screening and clinical records to evaluate the sensitivity and reliability of the current protocol . The audit identified 19 cases of primary CH , with a 1 : 154 incidence . Thirteen cases met the criteria for inclusion in the audit . Just over half of the eligible cases ( 7/13 ) were screen detected , while the remaining were detected clinically , suggesting limitations in screening sensitivity . The analysis revealed that the protocol missed permanent as well as transient cases , and that biochemical severity was not predictive of permanence . A revised screening protocol was developed and commenced in July FAU Brown , Ashleigh
Currently , Dutch newborns are screened for tyrosinemia type 1 ( TT1 ) using succinylacetone ( SA ) as the biomarker . Although the sensitivity of the test is high , a high number of false positives is observed . Here , the aim is to evaluate the current Dutch newborn screening protocol and to assess alternatives , specifically the use of biomarkers that are already being measured , to increase the positive predictive value ( PPV ) . TT1 screening was performed with the Revvity NeoBase assay between 2008 and 2017 , and since 2018 , the Revvity NeoBase 2 assay has been used . Data from 2018 to 2021 were used for evaluation . To simulate alternative screening protocols , these data were enriched with results of referrals from other periods and a false negative ( FN ) from In 2018 2021 , 693 , 821 newborns were screened , resulting in 23 referrals , of whom two were TT1 patients . For this period , to date , no FN have been reported , resulting in a provisional sensitivity of 100% , a specificity of 997% , and a PPV and negative predictive value of 9% and 100% , respectively . To improve the PPV , we combined SA , tyrosine ( tyr ) , tyr x SA and tyr/phenylalanine and achieved a PPV of 72% for this dataset without introducing FN in the original dataset . This illustrates that future screening for TT1 may benefit from the addition of these biomarkers . FAU Bouva , Marelle J
Newborn Bloodspot Screening ( NBS ) can detect severe treatable health conditions with onset during infancy . The parents of a newborn baby are vulnerable in the days after birth , and the optimal way to deliver the shocking and distressing news of a potential serious diagnosis is yet to be defined . More data are needed to determine whether access to a genetic counsellor ( GC ) improves families ' experiences with genetic conditions identified by NBS . This study aimed to explore the similarities and differences for parents who received a positive NBS result for Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) and received access to a GC ( GC cohort ) , to a cohort of parents who received a diagnosis for inborn errors of metabolism ( IEM ) and did not have access to a GC ( non GC cohort ) . Semi structured interviews explored the retrospective experiences of receiving the NBS result , including diagnosis implications and subsequent adaptation to respective genetic diagnoses . Inductive thematic analysis was used from group comparison . 7 SMA families and 5 IEM families were included in the study . Four themes were identified : minimal pre test counselling ; perceived lack of local healthcare team knowledge ; enabling factors for adaptation ; implications for both individuals and their families . Both the GC and non GC cohorts reported insufficient counselling in the pre test period and described feeling traumatised at the time of the diagnosis delivery . Families without subsequent GC input described limited understanding of the disease due to the use of medicalized terms , as well as a decreased understanding of reproductive options , familial communication and subsequent cascade screening . GCs can support information needs and adaptation following a NBS diagnosis . FAU Sandelowsky , Samantha A
BACKGROUND : Newborn screening ( NBS ) is a preventive healthcare program aiming at identifying the inborn errors of metabolism ( IEMs ) in asymptomatic infants to reduce the risk of severe complications . The aim of this study was to report the first years ( 2016 2020 ) of the expanded NBS program in the Lombardy region , Italy . METHODS : Dried blood spots were collected from newborns ' heels at 48 72 h after birth . FIA MS/MS was performed to evaluate specific biochemical markers . Genetic confirmation was achieved via Sanger or NGS on newborns and reported to a clinical reference center ( CRC ) . RESULTS : A total of 343 , 507 newborns were tested ; 1414/343 , 507 resulted as positive to NBS and were reported to the CRC . A total of 209 newborns were diagnosed with IEMs : 206 infants received a diagnosis of IEM through NBS , confirmed by genetic analysis ; three neonates were not positive to NBS but were subsequentially diagnosed with IEMs . A total of 1208/343 , 507 were false positive cases . Twenty seven types of IEMs were diagnosed in 209 patients : 111 newborns were affected by aminoacidemias , 11 by urea cycle disorders , 27 by organic acidemias , 34 by fatty acid oxidation disorders , and 26 by secondary conditions . CONCLUSIONS : We report here for the first time the IEM incidence and distribution in the Lombardy region in the first five years of NBS . FAU Berardo , Clarissa
Metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) is a rare inherited disorder of lysosomal storage , caused by a deficiency in the arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) enzyme , leading to toxic accumulation of sulfatides , which progressively impair motor and cognitive function . MLD is a candidate for inclusion in newborn screening ( NBS ) programs , due to the narrow pre symptomatic window for effective therapeutic intervention . We set up a prospective pilot NBS program for MLD in Tuscany , based on a two step approach . The first tier test quantified four sulfatides ; if levels exceeded the cut off , we performed the second tier test by measuring ARSA activity on the same neonatal dried blood spot ( DBS ) . We performed the first tier test on 42 , 262 newborns over two years and the second tier test on residual neonatal DBS from 90 of them ( 21% ) . We recalled 10 newborns ( 02% ) for an additional DBS , due to insufficient residual material for a second tier test ( n = 4 ) or to low ARSA activity ( n = 6 ) . We found normal ARSA activity in all new DBS and identified no new cases of MLD . Retrospective analysis of eight neonatal and fifteen non neonatal DBS from patients with genetically confirmed MLD showed that the algorithm accurately identified MLD patients . This diagnostic algorithm proved feasible and accurate for early detection of MLD in prospective NBS . FAU Malvagia , Sabrina
BACKGROUND : Despite advances in immunotherapy , non small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) ' s clinical success is limited , possibly due to substantial immunological alterations in advanced cancer patients . This study examines the immunomodulatory effects of sEVs derived from lung adenocarcinoma ( ADC ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) on T cells . METHODS : SEVs were isolated from lung cancer cell lines and Jurkat E SEV size and morphology were analyzed by NTA and TEM , respectively , while Western blotting confirmed sEV markers . SEV uptake was assessed , followed by resazurin assay , RNA isolation , quantification , cDNA preparation , RT PCR , nano LC MS , and bioinformatic analysis , before and after treating Jurkat E1 cells with sEVs from A549 and SKMES RESULTS : Cancer derived sEVs were efficiently internalized by immune cells , reducing T cell viability . The real time PCR analysis showed downregulation of KI67 , BCL2 , BAX , TNFA , IL6 , TGFbeta , and IL10 , suggesting reduced proliferation , dysregulated apoptosis , and impaired inflammatory and immunosuppressive signaling , and the upregulation of GZMB and IL2 suggests retained cytotoxic potential but possibly dysfunctional T cell activation . Proteomic analysis revealed 39 differentially abundant proteins ( DAPs ) in ADC treated T cells and 276 in SCC treated T cells , with 19 shared DAPs . Gene Ontology ( GO ) analysis of these DAPs highlighted processes such as sEV biogenesis , metabolic pathways , and regulatory functions , with ADC sEVs influencing NAD metabolism , ECM binding , and oxidoreductase activity , while SCC sEVs affected mRNA stability , amino acid metabolism , and cadherin binding . The cytoplasmic colocalization suggests the presence of these proteins in the cellular and extracellular lumen , indicating the potential of further release of these proteins in the vesicles by T cells . CONCLUSION : Lung cancer derived sEVs regulate T cell activities through immunoregulatory signaling . The molecular interactions between sEVs and immune cells can reveal novel tumor immune regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic targets . FAU Padinharayil , Hafiza
The growing demand for functional foods has driven the search for bioactive compounds derived from plant proteins . Lupinus mutabilis " Tarwi " , a legume native to the Peruvian Andes , stands out for its high protein content and potential as a source of bioactive peptides ( BPs ) . In this study , the functionality of the proteins contained in the albumin fraction ( AF ) isolated by tangential ultrafiltration ( TFF ) was investigated by using the OmicsBox software . The identified proteins were functionally classified into three groups : cellular component ( 57% ) , molecular function ( 45% ) , and biological process ( 97% ) . The isolated AF was hydrolysed with the native protease PC7 ( HAP ) , optimizing the E/S ratio and time parameters . Additionally , sequential hydrolysis of the PC7 protease and alcalase ( HAPA ) was performed .

Resting metabolic rate ( RMR ) significantly impacts total daily energy expenditure , particularly on training days , and varies among trained individuals . Studies estimating RMR in this population show notable discrepancies . This study aimed to develop and validate new bioelectrical impedance analysis based ( BIA ) RMR equations for young athletes , using a calibration and a validation group of 219 and 51 participants , respectively . RMR was measured via indirect calorimetry , while body composition was assessed through DXA and BIA . Correlation and agreement were evaluated by using Pearson ' s correlation coefficients and Bland Altman analysis . Multiple linear regression was applied for the estimation of RMR and a one way ANOVA was used to compare the new BIA based equations with other specific formulas . A significant correlation was noted between the BIA and DXA measurements . The final equation , applicable to both genders , was significantly correlated with intracellular water ( ICW ) and trunk fat , predicting 1% of RMR variance . When analyzed separately , body weight and protein displayed a moderate correlation with RMR in men ( r = 616 , p < 001 ) , while ICW was correlated with the percentage of body fat in women ( r = 579 , p < 001 ) . In the validation group , the values obtained through the three BIA based equations were similar to the measured RMR , but differed significantly from those obtained through the four existing equations for trained individuals . In conclusion , the developed equations based on BIA mediated body composition analysis provide a reliable method for estimating RMR in trained populations daily . FAU Stampoulis , Theodoros
OBJECTIVES : Resistance training can improve body composition and physical function during and after breast cancer treatment and improve quality of life . It is unclear whether these changes persist once a person is no longer actively enrolled in a structured exercise regimen . Thus , we analyzed participants from the EXERT BC protocol , assessing an intense exercise regimen in women with breast cancer at one year . METHODS : All the participants were asked to undergo reassessment at one year . Current exercise habits , injuries , changes in medical history , body composition , handgrip strength , functional mobility and balance , and patient reported quality of life were assessed . Pairwise comparison was performed via the paired t test . RESULTS : Out of 40 initial participants , 33 returned for reevaluation , with 6 lost to follow up and 1 with unrelated hospitalization . The median age was 8 years , and stage at diagnosis was Weekly exercise was reported by 16 participants ( 5% ) , with 14 of the 16 following structured resistance training . Between completion of the EXERT BC and one year follow up , five women ( 2% ) experienced musculoskeletal injuries , which inhibited their ability to exercise . Three women ( 9% ) , who were no longer exercising experienced orthopedic injuries requiring medical intervention . The significant reduction in percent body fat , total body fat , excess fat , and increases in muscle mass , resting metabolic rate , and whole body phase angle dissipated at 1 year . Activity levels and quality of life were no longer significantly improved . However , strength , mobility , and balance remained significantly improved versus pre exercise measurements , whether a participant was still engaged in exercise or not . CONCLUSIONS : After a 3 month dose escalated resistance training regimen , exercise compliance was poor at one year . The anthropomorphic benefits of the regimen regressed by one year ; however , the improvements in strength , balance , and mobility persisted . FAU Champ , Colin E
Objectives : Type 1 diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemic episodes influenced by diet , sleep quality , chronotype , and physical activity , among others . While aerobic exercise is known to improve glycemic control , its effect on blood glucose regulation remains underexplored . Thus , this case study aimed to evaluate the effects of a prolonged and differentiated indoor and outdoor exercise intervention on glycemic control in an individual with type 1 diabetes . Methods : The participant ( age : 23 years ; weight : 95 kg ; height : 90 m ; Body Mass Index : 3 kg/m ; waist to hip ratio : 98 ; basal metabolic rate : 2015 kcal ; Heart Rate Maximum ( HRmax ) : 197 beats . min ( 1 ) ) completed two outdoor ( ~3800 m ) and two indoor sessions with self selected speed , in the initial 2 min stage , at a 0% grade slope . The grade increased by 2% at each stage during the uphill phase until reaching volitional fatigue , followed by a 2% decrease at each stage during the downhill phase until returning to a 0% grade . Blood pressure was assessed before and after each session . Daily nutrition intake , insulin intake , and blood glucose were continuously monitored . Dietary adherence ( PREvencion con DIeta MEDiterranea ) , sleep quality ( Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ) , chronotype ( Morningness Eveningness Questionnaire ) , and physical activity levels ( International Physical Activity Questionnaire ) were assessed before each session . The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale was used to measure enjoyment after each session . Results : The sessions were completed in ~44 and ~39 min with the participant achieving 84% ( outdoor ) and 96% ( indoor ) of their theoretical HRmax . The intervention resulted in glycemic improvements , with time spent in hyperglycemia ( >250 mg/dL ) decreasing from 46% to 0% , while time in the normal range ( 70 180 mg/dL ) increased to 96% . A 47% reduction in insulin units showed that insulin sensitivity also improved . Conclusions : Despite differences in intensity , indoor and outdoor activities yielded comparable benefits , with outdoor activities being perceived as more enjoyable ( outdoor : 5 +/ 7 ; indoor : 0 +/ 6 ) and positively impacting glycemic control , thus supporting the need for tailored strategies in diabetes management .

Background : The accuracy of measurement of cardiometabolic outcomes in terms of gaseous exchange and energy expenditure of individuals is crucial . The objective of this study was to compare the validity and reliability of the PNOE in measuring cardiometabolic outcomes from the respiratory gaseous exchange of healthy individuals during treadmill walking exercise . Methods : A total of 21 healthy subjects ( 15 male and 6 female ) aged 76 +/ 85 years took part in this study . Oxygen uptake ( VO ) , carbon dioxide production ( VCO ) , respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) , metabolic equivalents ( METs ) , tidal volume ( VT ) , and energy expenditure ( EE ) were measured using the PNOE and COSMED K5 portable systems during a twenty eight minute , four stage incremental protocol , where speed increased from 7 mph to 2 mph with a 2% incline on a treadmill . Test retest reliability was tested on separate days with trail repetition . Validity was evaluated by Bland Altman plots , intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) and mean percentage difference . Results : ICCs showed that VCO was in the good range ( 75 90 ) . The ICC of the RER from stages 1 to 3 of the incremental protocol and the VT from stages 2 to 4 of the incremental protocol showed good to excellent reliability . No clear trend was seen for VO , VCO , and EE datapoints with variations in speed . Pearson ' s correlation coefficients were moderately high ( r = 60 79 ) between VO , VCO , RER , METs , VT , and EE measured by the PNOE and K5 systems . All subjects , except for a few cases in VT , were within the upper and lower 95% confidence intervals of the acceptable range of the Bland Altman plots . Conclusions : The PNOE system is a valid and reliable measure of cardiometabolic outcomes and is comparable to the COSMED K5 system . FAU Kwok , Manny M Y
Background : Firefighters are at risk for developing metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes due to occupational related stress and poor health behaviors . Firefighters often experience chronic inflammatory responses that may contribute to the development of insulin resistance . This study examined the relationship between systemic inflammation markers and glycemic control markers in firefighters . Methods : Blood samples were collected from twenty full time male firefighters to assess HbA1c , fasting glucose , and insulin to estimate the Homeostatic Model of Assessment of Insulin Resistance ( HOMA IR ) , C reactive protein ( CRP ) , and homocysteine . Body composition and cardiovascular metrics were also recorded . Pearson partial correlation analyses were performed to evaluate relationships between homocysteine and CRP and the variables HOMA IR and HbA1c while controlling for age and body fat percentage ( BF% ) . SPSS version 29 was used for all analyses ( alpha = 05 ) . Data transformation was used where appropriate to ensure the normal distribution of each variable . Results : A significant positive correlation was found between homocysteine and HbA1c before ( p = 006 , r = 605 ) and after controlling for age and BF% ( p ( partial ) = 013 , r ( partial ) = 588 ) , indicating that homocysteine levels are associated with impaired glycemic control in firefighters . No other relationships were found to be significant . Conclusions : The findings support a potential link between systemic inflammation and poor glycemic control in firefighters . Due to the occupational hazards that contribute to chronic inflammation , targeted interventions such as dietary modifications may help decrease the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in this high risk population .

Objectives : This study examined physiological , biochemical , and performance adaptations in 18 semi professional male soccer players across three seasonal phases : pre season initiation ( PS ) , pre competition ( PC ) , and mid season ( MS ) . Methods : Assessments included physical/performance/hormonal/biochemical markers . Results : From PS to PC , body fat ( Cohen ' s d = 88 ; p </= 01 ) and speed drop rate ( Cohen ' s d = 52 ; p </= 01 ) significantly decreased , while V̇Omax ( Cohen ' s d = 80 ; p </= 01 ) , velocity at V̇Omax ( Cohen ' s d = 86 ; p </= 01 ) , and velocity at the second ventilatory threshold ( Cohen ' s d = 54 ; p </= 01 ) significantly increased . Significant fluctuations were observed in creatine kinase ( Cohen ' s d = 34 ; p </= 01 ) , myoglobin ( Cohen ' s d = 66 ; p </= 01 ) , and cortisol ( Cohen ' s d = 14 ; p </= 01 ) levels . From PS to MS , further reductions in body fat ( Cohen ' s d = 81 ; p </= 01 ) and speed drop rate ( Cohen ' s d = 12 ; p </= 01 ) were observed , along with significant improvements in countermovement jump performance ( Cohen ' s d = 08 ; p </= 01 ) and cardiorespiratory fitness ( Cohen ' s d >/= 83 ; p </= 01 ) . Creatine kinase ( Cohen ' s d = 82 ; p </= 01 ) , myoglobin ( Cohen ' s d = 50 ; p </= 01 ) , interleukin 6 ( Cohen ' s d = 24 ; p </= 01 ) , and testosterone ( Cohen ' s d = 92 ; p </= 01 ) significantly increased . Stability in lower limb strength , flexibility , triglycerides , C reactive protein , ferritin , liver enzymes , and most hematological parameters suggest resilience to seasonal demands . Conclusions : Seasonal training enhanced fitness and hormonal balance while maintaining physiological stability . These findings underscore the importance of periodized training to manage muscle damage and sustain an anabolic hormonal profile for peak performance . Consistent diet and training support metabolic health , while tailored recovery strategies and season specific interventions are essential for optimizing performance and minimizing injury risk .

BACKGROUND : Previous evidence demonstrated DNA methylation changes in response to stress in plants , showing rapid changes within a limited time frame . Exposure to self DNA inhibits seedling root elongation , and it was shown that it causes changes in CG DNA methylation in Lactuca sativa . We assessed cytosine methylation changes and associated gene expression patterns in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana Col 0 seedlings exposed to self DNA for 6 and 24 h . METHODS : We used whole genome bisulfite sequencing ( WGBS ) and RNA seq analyses to assess genomic cytosine methylation and corresponding gene expression , respectively , on DNA and RNA extracted with commercial kits from roots exposed to self DNA by an original setup . Fifteen hundred roots replicates , including the control in distilled water , were collected after exposure . Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 platform and Ultralow Methyl Seq System for RNA and DNA WGBS , respectively . RESULTS : Gene expression in roots exposed to self DNA differed from that of untreated controls , with a total of 305 genes differentially expressed and 87 ontologies enriched in at least one treatment vs . control comparison , and particularly after 24 h of exposure . DNA methylation , particularly in CHG and CHH contexts , was also different , with hyper and hypomethylation prevailing in treatments vs . controls at 6 h and 24 h , respectively . Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) analysis , Gene Ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis , and differentially methylated regions ( DMRs ) analysis , provided an integrated understanding of the changes associated with self DNA exposure . Our results suggest differential gene expression associated with DNA methylation in response to self DNA exposure in A . thaliana roots , enhanced after prolonged exposure . CONCLUSIONS : Main functional indications of association between DNA methylation and gene expression involved hypomethylation and downregulation of genes related to nucleotide/nucleoside metabolism ( ATP synthase subunit ) and cell wall structure ( XyG synthase ) , consistent with previous observations from metabolomics and physiological studies . Further confirmation of these findings will contribute to improving our understanding of the plant molecular response to self DNA and its implications in stress responses . FAU Ronchi , Alessia
In eukaryotic cells , communication between organelles and the coordination of their activities depend on membrane contact sites ( MCS ) . How MCS are regulated under the dynamic cellular environment remains poorly understood . Here , we investigate how Pex30 , a membrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , regulates multiple MCS in budding yeast . We show that Pex30 is critical for the integrity of ER MCS with peroxisomes and vacuoles . This requires the dysferlin ( DysF ) domain on the Pex30 cytosolic tail . This domain binds to phosphatidic acid ( PA ) both in vitro and in silico , and it is important for normal PA metabolism in vivo . The DysF domain is evolutionarily conserved and may play a general role in PA homeostasis across eukaryotes . We further show that the ER vacuole MCS requires a Pex30 C terminal domain of unknown function and that its activity is controlled by phosphorylation in response to metabolic cues . These findings provide new insights into the dynamic nature of MCS and their coordination with cellular metabolism .
Lipid droplets ( LDs ) are ubiquitous neutral lipid storage organelles that form at discrete subdomains in the ER bilayer . The assembly of these ER subdomains and the mechanism by which proteins are recruited to them is poorly understood . Here , we investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of Pex30 at the ER LD membrane contact sites ( MCSs ) . Pex30 , an ER membrane shaping protein , has a reticulon homology domain , a dysferlin ( DysF ) domain , and a Duf4196 domain . Deletion of SEI1 , which codes for seipin , a highly conserved protein required for LD biogenesis , results in accumulation of Pex30 and phosphatidic acid ( PA ) at ER LD contact sites . We show that PA recruits Pex30 at ER subdomains by binding to the DysF domain . The distribution of Pex30 as well as PA is also affected by phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) levels . We propose that PA regulates the spatiotemporal distribution of Pex30 at ER subdomains that plays a critical role in driving the formation of LDs in the ER membrane .
Toxoplasma gondii ( T . gondii ) , a parasitic protozoan capable of infecting nearly all warm blooded animals , causes significant economic losses in livestock and poses a significant threat to both animal and public health . Despite its impact , no ideal vaccine is currently available to prevent toxoplasmosis . Vesicular transport plays a crucial role in the life cycle of T . gondii , and proteins involved in this process such as those containing C2 domains may serve as novel targets for the development of live attenuated vaccines . In this study , we evaluated the feasibility of a C2 domain containing protein ( TGME49_203240 ) as a live attenuated vaccine candidate . Our findings suggest that TGME49_203240 may be involved in vesicular transport and that it is essential for T . gondii growth . Deletion of TGME49_203240 reduced parasite virulence and impaired tissue cyst formation in mice . Moreover , mice vaccinated with ME49Delta203240 were protected against the lethal challenge of the tachyzoites of T . gondii I , II , III strains and cysts of II strain . In addition , the ME49Delta203240 strain elicited robust immune responses , including the production of high levels of specific IgG antibodies and key cytokines ( IFN gamma , TNF alpha and IL 12 ) . These findings highlight TGME49_203240 as a promising target for the development of a live attenuated vaccine against T . gondii .
Ocular surface inflammation and injury often lead to fibrosis and impaired vision . Myofibroblasts directly promote fibrosis by producing excessive extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins and alpha smooth muscle actin ( a SMA ) . In addition , macrophages have been shown to promote fibrosis by secreting pro fibrotic factors to stimulate myofibroblast formation . However , the capacity of macrophages to directly remodel ECM remains understudied . This study utilized a mouse model of corneal injury and fibrosis to determine whether macrophages transform into myofibroblast like cells during ocular surface inflammation . Following injury , F4/80 + a SMA+ macrophages were present at the early stages of wound healing and increased in frequency and a SMA intensity during the remodeling stage . The increase in F4/80 + a SMA+ macrophages occurred due to the microenvironment transitioning from an inflammatory state to a pro fibrotic state . Activated human and mouse macrophages treated with pro fibrotic cytokines ( IL 10 and TGF beta1 ) transitioned to a SMA+ macrophages , adopting a spindle like phenotype and expressing signature myofibroblast ECM and cytoskeletal components , including a SMA , desmin , fibronectin , and collagen III . Furthermore , gel contraction assays showed a SMA+ macrophages significantly contracted a collagen gel , making them functionally resemble myofibroblasts . The results of this study indicate that macrophages have the capacity to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts during ocular surface inflammation .
Hydroxytyrosol ( HT ) has various biological and pharmacological activities , including potent antioxidant activity . The efficient synthesis of HT and tyrosol has been achieved by microbial synthesis . However , more strategies are needed to enhance its yield and meet the demands of industrialization . In this study , SceARO10 and EcoyahK were used for the de novo synthesis of tyrosol in Escherichia coli using a temperature inducible system . Different sources of phenolic acid decarboxylase and alcohol reductase were investigated , with YliARO10 and YliPAR4 from Yarrowia lipolytica showing the best catalytic performance , yielding 05 g/L of tyrosol at 60 h in shake flasks , the highest yield reported . Next , EblHpaBC from E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) was introduced for HT biosynthesis , and the HT related degradation gene mhpB was functionally characterized in E . coli . Subsequently , by enhancing precursor supply , eliminating competing metabolic pathways , and knocking out mhpB , the HT yield reached 28 g/L after 60 h . Finally , in a 5 L bioreactor , titers of 18 and 97 g/L of tyrosol and HT were achieved for the first time using a temperature induced strategy . This study presents a method for the modification of microbial chassis for the efficient synthesis of tyrosol and HT . FAU Chen , Xiaochuan
Nitric oxide ( NO ) serves as a versatile signaling molecule governing diverse biological processes , primarily through post translational modifications such as S nitrosylation . The enzyme glutathione S nitrosoglutathione reductase ( GSNOR ) plays a central role in NO homeostasis by modulating cellular levels of S nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO ) , thereby controlling protein S nitrosylation dynamics . However , the functional significance of GSNOR in fungal pathogenicity remains insufficiently characterized . In this study , we investigated the function of CgGSNOR in the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides . Deletion of CgGSNOR disrupted nitrosative homeostasis , leading to elevated NO accumulation , increased protein S nitrosylation levels , and mitochondrial dysfunction as evidenced by reduced ATP production and altered ROS levels . Proteomic and structural analyses identified cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B ( CgCOX6B ) as a key target of S nitrosylation . Functional characterization revealed that CgCOX6B is essential for appressorial turgor maintenance and fungal pathogenicity . Site directed mutagenesis demonstrated that three conserved cysteine residues ( Cys42 , Cys62 , and Cys73 ) are critical for CgCOX6B function and are susceptible to S nitrosylation induced disruption . Notably , the CgCOX6B knockout strain exhibited increased sensitivity to Iprodione , a widely used fungicide , and this sensitivity was further amplified by NO donor treatment . Together , our findings uncover a GSNOR dependent redox regulatory axis that links NO signaling , mitochondrial function , and fungal pathogenicity , offering potential targets for antifungal strategies via manipulation of NO signaling networks . IMPORTANCEColletotrichum gloeosporioides is a globally significant fungal pathogen responsible for anthracnose diseases , causing losses across a wide range of crops . Although nitric oxide ( NO ) signaling and its post translational regulatory mechanism , S nitrosylation , are known to play pivotal roles in fungal biology , their specific contributions to pathogenicity remain poorly characterized . This study identifies glutathione S nitrosoglutathione reductase ( GSNOR ) as a critical regulator of NO homeostasis in C . gloeosporioides and demonstrates its critical role in regulating fungal growth , conidiation , and pathogenicity . We uncover cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B ( COX6B ) as a key target of S nitrosylation , required for fungal energy metabolism , host infection , and resistance to fungicides . Furthermore , we reveal that exogenous NO supplementation using sodium nitroprusside synergistically enhances the antifungal activity of Iprodione . These findings advance our understanding of redox regulation in fungal pathogenesis and highlight GSNOR and COX6B as promising molecular targets for developing antifungal approaches to reduce crop losses .

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : Management of autoimmune encephalitis ( AE ) is challenging due to a lack of reliable biomarkers . We here assess the combination of glial fibrillary acid protein ( GFAP ) and neurofilament ( NfL ) as biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring of AE . METHODS : GFAP and NfL CSF levels ( cGFAP , cNfL ) of 42 AE patients were correlated with CSF markers of neuroinflammation . NfL/GFAP ratios were compared between patients with stable and active AE , stable and active multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , and patients undergoing diagnostic lumbar puncture without evident pathological alterations ( controls ) . RESULTS : In patients with AE , cGFAP levels showed strong correlations with albumin and IgG quotients and moderate correlations with CSF cell count ; cNfL levels showed weak correlations with albumin quotients . cGFAP and cNfL levels showed no significant differences between patients with and without epileptic activity or inflammatory MRI lesions . Both sNfL and sGFAP correlated with the Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis . Compared to NfL or GFAP alone , the NfL/GFAP ratio from CSF or serum led to a clearer separation of AE from MS patients and controls . Furthermore , serum NfL/GFAP ratios better discriminated active from stable AE . CONCLUSION : cGFAP levels indicate intrathecal inflammatory processes in patients with active AE to a stronger degree than cNfL levels . Serum NfL/GFAP ratios recognize active AE , suggesting this ratio identifies AE patients with CNS compartmentalized neuronal injury ( autoantibody mediated or cytotoxic ) behind a relatively intact blood brain barrier . Our findings indicate that the NfL/GFAP ratio can function as a blood based biomarker , aiding clinicians with diagnosis and disease management of AE .
Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis ( hATTR ) is a rare , often fatal disease characterized by the abnormal aggregation of atypical transthyretin fibrils . Given the variability in the penetrance and clinical manifestations of hATTR , the role of nongenetic factors , particularly those related to the gut microbiota , warrants investigation . We conducted a cross sectional study , examining the untargeted serum metabolome and gut metagenome in 13 patients with hATTR and 22 healthy controls . Significant disparities were observed in both the serum metabolome and gut microbiome of individuals with hATTR when compared to healthy controls . Notably , the serum levels of gamma aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) and taurine were markedly decreased in the hATTR group , with the most pronounced reduction in those exhibiting hATTR related cardiac amyloidosis . Additionally , commensals such as Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum , Lactobacillus rogosae , and Hungatella hathewayi were significantly diminished in hATTR patients and were positively correlated with the metabolite module containing GABA and taurine . Metagenomic and metabolomic pathway enrichment analyses collectively revealed disruptions in glutamate and taurine metabolism in hATTR . Our findings imply that patients with hATTR may exhibit metabolic irregularities in glutamate and taurine , potentially associated with an imbalance in the gut microbiota . IMPORTANCE : Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis ( hATTR ) is influenced not only by genetic factors but also by environmental or host factors during its onset and progression . Previous studies have independently examined the metabolome or gut microbiome in hATTR , but the interplay between the microbiota and metabolism under this condition remains largely unknown . Our cross sectional study represents the first comprehensive integration of gut metagenome and serum metabolome analyses in hATTR patients . We observed disturbances in glutamate and taurine metabolism among these patients , which correlated with distinctive shifts in the gut microbiota . This study offers insights into the intricate dynamics among gut dysbiosis , metabolic imbalances , and the progression of hATTR , suggesting directions for future research into the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic strategies .

Liver fibrosis is a pathological process characterized by the excessive deposition of diffuse extracellular matrix in the liver , serving as a reparative response of the body to chronic liver injury . Daidzein ( DAI ) is an isoflavone compound primarily derived from leguminous plants , such as soybeans and kudzu root . Numerous studies have demonstrated its significant anti inflammatory and antioxidant properties ; however , the extent of its role in anti hepatic fibrosis remains uncertain . This study aimed to investigate whether DAI exerts a therapeutic effect on liver fibrosis and to elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms . In this study , we primarily investigated the anti hepatic fibrosis effects of DAI . We established two mouse models of liver fibrosis through intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride ( CCl ) and bile duct ligation ( BDL ) . Following serum free treatment , we administered transforming growth factor beta1 to stimulate LX 2 cells , thereby creating a model for the activation of hepatic stellate cell ( HSC ) lines . DAI mitigated liver injury induced by CCl and BDL , as evidenced by decreased serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , and liver hydroxyproline . Furthermore , DAI also diminished the inflammatory response associated with CCl and BDL . Additionally , DAI reduced the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and type I collagen , alpha 1 , demonstrating anti hepatic fibrosis effects by lowering the expression of integrin alphaV , integrin beta1 , and YAP , while simultaneously increasing the protein expression of phosphorylated YAP ( Ser 397 ) . The use of the YAP inhibitor verteporfin in LX 2 , along with YAP silencing treatment , confirmed that DAI inhibits the activation of HSCs through the regulation of YAP . This study demonstrated that DAI can mitigate liver injury and inflammatory responses induced by CCl and BDL . It inhibited the activation of HSCs and reduced liver fibrosis by targeting the integrin/YAP signaling pathway . These findings suggested that DAI may serve as a potential candidate for anti hepatic fibrosis chemical drugs . FAU Bai , Junjie
Progressive intensification of drought regimes worldwide threatens wood decomposition a critical biogeochemical process in forest carbon cycling . However , the interactions between microbial strategies , wood traits and microclimate in regulating wood decomposition remain poorly understood under drought conditions . In a throughfall exclusion experiment ( control 35% and 70% rainfall reduction ) across 12 tree species , we found that drought induced reductions in wood CO efflux rates were primarily driven by wood traits ( density and carbon reduction ) and shifts in fungal K/r strategies . Coarse wood debris with higher Basidiomycota and lower Ascomycota abundance decomposed faster . Significant positive correlations were observed between fungal K/r strategies and wood CO efflux under control , 35% , and 70% rainfall reduction , while bacterial strategies showed no correlation . Our findings highlight the greater drought sensitivity of fungi than bacteria , emphasising their critical role in forest carbon dynamics and informing carbon models to improve the prediction of climate biosphere feedback in the changing world .

BACKGROUND : Metabolic and bariatric surgery is one of the most efficacious treatments for obesity . The increasing incidence of referrals to intestinal rehabilitation programs and the necessity for long term parenteral nutrition because of bariatric surgery complications have gained attention , yet data remain limited . Our objectives were to assess parenteral nutrition related complication rates of patients requiring long term parenteral nutrition because of bariatric surgery complications and compare outcomes between types of metabolic and bariatric surgery . METHODS : This was a descriptive cohort ( n = 25 ) study , which gathered data from patients enrolled in the national registry with a history of metabolic and bariatric surgery at baseline and 2 years and included demographics , biochemical parameters , parenteral regimens , line sepsis , hospitalizations , and functional status . RESULTS : In this study , 92% were women with a mean age of 8 +/ 6 years . The most prevalent procedure performed was Roux en Y gastric bypass ( 60% ) . Short bowel syndrome was observed in 40% of our cohort ( n = 10 ) . After 2 years , there was a significant reduction in the need for parenteral nutrition compared with baseline , with 5% of patients achieving weaning . No significant disparities were observed in the incidence of line sepsis , hospitalizations , or Karnofsky performance status between baseline and the 2 year follow up , regardless of the type of surgery . Roux en Y gastric bypass was associated with lower body mass index at the 2 year mark . CONCLUSION : In post metabolic and bariatric surgery patients , long term parenteral nutrition is well tolerated based on clinical outcomes and functional status is not influenced by the type of surgery .

CONTEXT : Apigenin , a naturally flavonoid , is reported to have protective effects in chronic and metabolic diseases . But the therapeutic or ameliorative effects of apigenin on atherosclerosis are not known . OBJECTIVE : Our study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of apigenin on preventing atherosclerosis by enhancing selective autophagy/lipophagy and promoting RCT process . MATERIALS AND METHODS : ApoE ( / ) mice fed with a high fat diet ( HFD ) for 18 weeks were used to establish atherosclerosis model . Oil Red O staining of the plaques in the aorta and the heart was used to determine the severity of atherosclerosis . The autophagy flux was evaluated by western blot and reverse transcription quantitative PCR ( RT qPCR ) . Then triton WR 1339 ( TWR ) was injected into muscles of C57BL/6 mice , and the role of autophagy was assessed by autophagy inhibitor LY294002 intervention . The transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and immunofluorescence microscopy analysis ( IFM ) were used to elucidate the lipid lowering mechanism of apigenin . RESULTS : In HFD induced mice , apigenin inhibited the dangerous progression of atherosclerosis through decreasing lipid deposition in plaques , lowering serum and liver lipid contents , activating autophagy and promoting reverse cholesterol transport ( RCT ) . In TWR induced mice , apigenin reduced the serum and liver lipid levels , enhanced the autophagy flux and increased RCT , but the above effects of apigenin were weakened by LY The TEM and IFM images revealed that apigenin promoted the formation of autophagosomes and the co localization between autophagy proteins with lipid protein . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS : The lipid lowering effects of apigenin were mediated through promoting RCT and enhancing selective lipophagy , meanwhile it provided a potential therapeutic option for atherosclerosis .

Exercise induced inflammation and free radical production are crucial for recovery , yet excess inflammation poses risks to equine athletes , leading to conditions like arthritis . Spirulina , recognized for its antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties , could mitigate degenerative diseases without hindering post exercise recovery . This study investigates Spirulina ' s direct impact on cartilage responses to LPS induced inflammation in normoxic and hypoxic conditions , focusing on outcomes relevant to cartilage matrix turnover and exercise induced inflammation . Spirulina underwent simulated digestion and liver metabolism , yielding a simulated biological extract ( SP ( sim ) ) . In the normoxic experiment , porcine cartilage explants were cultured with SP ( sim ) ( 0 , 30 , or 90 mug/mL ) for 72 h after 24 h in basal media , with LPS ( 0 or 10 mug/mL ) added for the final 48 h . The hypoxic experiment mirrored this , with explants transferred to a hypoxia chamber for the final 48 h . Media samples collected at 0 , 24 , and 48 h were analyzed for biomarkers related to cartilage turnover ( GAG ) , and exercise induced inflammation ( IL 6 and NO ) . Cell viability , assessed by live : dead staining , remained > 97% and unaffected by oxygen tension . In normoxic conditions , SP ( sim ) ( 30 mug/mL ) significantly reduced GAG release at 48 h . Under hypoxia , SP ( sim ) ( 30 and 90 mug/mL ) inhibited LPS induced GAG release . SP ( sim ) ( 90 mug/mL ) increased IL 6 and NO production in LPS stimulated explants in normoxia , and a similar effect was observed with the lower SP ( sim ) dose ( 30 mug/mL ) in hypoxic conditions . These results suggest that Spirulina may enhance cartilage mediators , potentially promoting healthy cartilage turnover during exercise recovery . FAU Golestani , Nadia
Microbial adaptations to resource availability are crucial to predict the responses of ecosystems to carbon ( C ) changes , yet viral roles in C cycling under varying levels of C remain elusive . Through metagenomic analysis of soils with contrasting C availability , a total of 24 , 789 viral contigs predominantly represent Microviridae and Siphoviridae . The soils with low C availability ( straw removal ) harbored 21% lysogenic viruses and enriched auxiliary metabolic genes ( AMGs ) related to C degradation ( p < 05 ) . Conversely , the soils with high C availability ( straw returning ) show 93% lytic viruses , stronger virus bacteria symbiosis , and numerous host functional genes related to C cycling and viral AMGs linked to C fixation ( p < 05 ) . Furthermore , these findings show that the addition of viruses boosted microbial metabolic efficiency and recalcitrant C accumulation ( p < 05 ) , with lytic activity accelerating organic C turnover via nutrient release and necromass formation . Overall , this study demonstrates viruses as key regulators of sustainable sequestration of C through host driven metabolic optimization .
Ficolin 3 ( FCN3 ) is a pattern recognition molecule that activates the complement system via the lectin pathway . While its immunological roles are known , the specific mechanisms by which FCN3 affects cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) pathogenesis remain unclear . In this study , we investigated FCN3 expression in CCA and benign cells , as well as tumor versus non tumor tissues , using RT qPCR and Western blotting analyses . The effects of FCN3 on CCA cell proliferation , migration , and invasion were analyzed through CCK 8 , EdU , transwell , and wound healing assays , with in vivo studies supporting these findings . The complement mediated cytotoxicity of CCA cells was assessed using human serum with or without heat inactivation and an anti C6 blocking antibody . Immunocytochemical staining was used to examine membrane attack complex ( MAC ) deposition , and an immunoprecipitation assay was adopted to evaluate the interaction between FCN3 and MASP family members . The role of FCN3 in inducing necroptosis was explored through transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and Western blotting analysis , focusing on the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway . The results of the study demonstrate that FCN3 expression was significantly lower in CCA cells and tissues . Overexpressing FCN3 suppressed cell proliferation and migration , enhanced complement mediated cytotoxicity via MASP2 binding , and increased MAC deposition . FCN3 also induced necroptosis through activating the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway . These results highlight FCN3 as a tumor suppressor in CCA and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target for this malignancy .
Previous studies have reported that walking is associated with a lower risk of several metabolic diseases ; however , evidence of its association with gout , a metabolic condition , is lacking . We conducted cohort studies using data from the UK Biobank ( 2013 2021 ) to examine the relationship of walking volume and intensity with the risk of incident gout . We included 92 , 066 participants who were free of gout and had valid baseline 7 day accelerometer data , which allowed us to derive walking volume ( total steps ) , walking intensity ( peak 30 minute cadence ) , and their combination ( purposeful steps ) . Hazard ratios ( HRs ) for incident gout were estimated across different walking activity metrics groups using Cox proportional hazard models . During a mean follow up period of 93 years , 706 participants developed incident gout . Walking volume and intensity alone showed no significant relationship to the risk of incident gout . However , compared with the low group ( <5 , 000 steps/day ) of purposeful steps , the risk of incident gout was lower in the middle group ( 5 , 000 7 , 999 steps/day ) and high ( >/=8 , 000 steps/day ) group , with adjusted HRs and 95% confidence intervals of 78 ( 66 94 ) and 72 ( 58 90 ) , respectively ( P for trend =003 ) . These findings offer valuable insights for developing walking based recommendations to prevent incident gout .
BACKGROUND AND AIM : Lipid metabolism is altered in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection and chronic liver diseases , but common and unique pathways have not been elucidated , limiting prevention and treatment strategies . The aim of this study was to discover lipid metabolite signatures for persons with HIV ( PWH ) , PWH with HCV coinfection ( PWH HCV ) , and individuals with metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease and steatohepatitis ( MASLD , MASH ) . METHODS : Plasma metabolite profiling was performed in adult participants in five cohorts from a single center : PWH ( N = 50 ) , PWH HCV ( N = 50 ) , HIV negative biopsy proven MASLD ( N = 46 ) and MASH ( N = 50 ) , and controls without HIV or chronic liver disease ( N = 29 ) . Plasma metabolites were assessed using Biocrates Q500 , Bile Acid , and oxylipin assays . Latent factor analysis along with unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were performed . Significance was defined as p value < 05 and false discovery rate ( FDR ) < RESULTS : Compared to controls , 457 of 816 measured metabolites were detected at different levels in PWH , 352 in PWH HCV , 466 in MASLD , and 487 in MASH . Triglycerides and oxylipins were increased across disease states , but to a higher degree in PWH . PWH HCV had a distinct metabolite signature with decreased ceramides and sphingomyelins . Levels of bile acid , amino acid , and fatty acid metabolites also differentiated cohorts . CONCLUSIONS : Lipid metabolites demonstrated pathways common to , and unique to , HIV , HCV , and MASLD . Further studies will hopefully reveal the pathogenic role of these metabolites in liver disease severity , particularly in PWH with steatotic liver disease .
FAT atypical cadherin 1 ( FAT1 ) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) , exhibiting the highest mutation rate across different tumor types . Although FAT1 ' s role has attracted considerable attention , its impact on cancer metabolism and treatment resistance remains poorly understood . In this study , it is demonstrated that knockout of mutant FAT1 in HNSCC cells attenuates CPT1A driven fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) through downregulation of the transcription factor ASCL2 , leading to marked suppression of tumor growth . Notably , FAT1 mutant HNSCC cells exhibit resistance to the TCA cycle inhibitor CPI 613 through activation of CPT1A mediated FAO , whereas genetic ablation of mutant FAT1 restores sensitivity to CPI To achieve in vivo depletion of FAT1 , LNP sgFAT1 is developed , a novel lipid nanoparticle ( LNP ) system encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and FAT1 targeting sgRNA . In murine models bearing FAT1 mutant head and neck tumors , LNP sgFAT1 demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity when combined with CPI Collectively , these findings establish that mutant FAT1 drives CPT1A dependent FAO , facilitating a metabolic bypass that confers resistance to TCA cycle inhibition in HNSCC . This mechanistic insight highlights promising opportunities for combinatorial therapeutic strategies co targeting genetic and metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer .
Natural microbes coexist in a diverse species population with competition for space and nutrient resources . However , the molecular mechanisms underpinning the regulatory networks of microbes among themselves and with their host are still in infancy . Here , it is reported that Drosophila and the commensal Lactiplantibacillus plantarum form an alliance to compete with the pathogenic Serratia marcescens using the integrated three species model system . In the dual species model , larvae diminish the L . plantarum population , but reversibly increase lactate production through altering its transcriptional reprogramming . In the tripartite species model , larvae facilitate the growth of L . plantarum that confers colonization resistance against S . marcescens . On the other hand , S . marcescens launches sophisticated arms race strategies to impair colonization resistance by sensing lactate derived from L . plantarum . More importantly , the S . marcescens population challenged with Drosophila and L . plantarum adaptively diverge into virulent and reduced virulence subclusters with an increase in resistance heterogeneity . To form the alliance with Drosophila , heterogeneity in lactate generation is broadened among L . plantarum subpopulations . Altogether , these findings provide an insight into the host commensal pathogen symbiosis at both bulk and single cell resolutions , advancing fundamental concepts of precise manipulation of bacterial communities .
Backbone N methylation is a pivotal peptide modification that enhances lipophilicity , metabolic stability , and binding affinity or specificity , thereby improving bioactive peptides ' bioavailability . Substitution of a backbone amide hydrogen with a methyl group is a three step procedure which is fully integrated with solid phase peptide synthesis strategy and usually takes about 4 h . We have revolutionized this process by optimizing the method and slashing the total N methylation procedure time from 4 h to just 40 min . Moreover , we demonstrate that N methylation can be equally efficient regardless of the laboratory equipment used , such as a standard laboratory shaker , microwave synthesizer , or common ultrasonic bath . Our study not only results in acceleration of the N methylation process during solid phase peptide synthesis but also offers a flexible choice of laboratory equipment , making peptide modifications more efficient and achievable .

In both vertebrates and invertebrates , commissural neurons prevent premature responsiveness to the midline repellant Slit by downregulating surface levels of its receptor Roundabout1 ( Robo1 ) . In Drosophila , Commissureless ( Comm ) plays a critical role in this process ; however , there is conflicting data on the underlying molecular mechanism . Here , we demonstrate that the conserved PY motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of Comm are required allow the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of Robo Disruption of these motifs prevents Comm from localizing to Lamp1 positive late endosomes and to promote axon growth across the midline in vivo . In addition , we conclusively demonstrate a role for Nedd4 in midline crossing . Genetic analysis shows that nedd4 mutations result in midline crossing defects in the Drosophila embryonic nerve cord , which can be rescued by introduction of exogenous Nedd Biochemical evidence shows that Nedd4 incorporates into a three member complex with Comm and Robo1 in a PY motif dependent manner . Finally , we present genetic evidence that Nedd4 acts with Comm in the embryonic nerve cord to downregulate Robo1 levels . Taken together , these findings demonstrate that Comm promotes midline crossing in the nerve cord by facilitating Robo1 ubiquitination by Nedd4 , ultimately leading to its degradation .
Aims : Hyperammonemia , defined by elevated ammonia levels , may co occur in various neurological disorders , but its effects on cerebrovascularity are not fully understood . This study aimed to investigate how hyperammonemia affects brain endothelial cells senescence and selected within in silico analysis micro RNA 183 5p in this process . Results : Reduction in cerebrovascular density in hyperammonemia induced rats , similar to that seen in 12 month old rats , using von Willebrand factor staining , was observed . MicroRNA ( miRNA ) profile analysis of the brain cortex and plasma identified miRNA 183 5p contributing to endothelial senescence . In vitro studies of ammonia treated rat brain endothelial cell line 4 showed senescent features , including increased beta galactosidase activity , higher mRNA levels and fluorescence intensity of p16 and p21 , and altered senescence associated secretory phenotype . Additionally , the transfection of miRNA 183 5p mimic induced similar senescent characteristics in endothelial cells , whereas miRNA 183 5p mimic inhibition reversed some effects . Innovation : This study is the first to link hyperammonemia induced cerebrovascular dysfunction with miRNA 183 5p , highlighting its role in promoting endothelial senescence . The findings suggest that miRNA 183 5p could be a target for therapeutic interventions , preventing ammonia induced brain endothelial dysfunction . Conclusion : Hyperammonemia promotes brain endothelial cells senescence through miRNA 183 5p , reducing cerebrovascular density . This may contribute to cerebral dysfunction seen in hyperammonemia associated neurological disorders . Targeting miRNA 183 5p could offer a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate endothelial dysfunction and preserve brain health in hyperammonemia . Antioxid .

Human TENT5 family comprises four members ( A D ) associated with different diseases of secretory cells . Homozygous mutations in TENT5A cause a rare form of osteogenesis imperfecta due to impaired collagen deposition by osteoblasts . TENT5C is frequently mutated or deleted in patients with multiple myeloma , the cancer of antibody secreting plasma cells , and TENT5D alterations result in male infertility . TENT5 members are noncanonical poly ( A ) polymerases that selectively stabilize mRNAs encoding endoplasmic reticulum imported proteins , thus promoting the expression of secretory cargoes and proteins involved in folding , glycosylation , and trafficking along the secretory apparatus . This specificity has been proposed to be linked to TENT5 localization at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum , thanks to their interaction with transmembrane FNDC3 proteins . Recently , key roles of TENT5 proteins have been described in cancer , bone homeostasis , immunity , stemness , and fertility . This review will comprehensively analyze the identified cellular functions of this novel family of secretory tuners in physiological and pathological conditions , highlighting the proposed molecular mechanisms and the remaining open questions .
BACKGROUND : Biomodifiers can reinforce the collagen matrix , improving the biomechanical and biochemical properties of dentin . OBJECTIVES : The present study aimed to evaluate how 5% phosphorylated chitosan ( P Chi ) and 5 mol/L carbodiimide ( EDC ) affect the surface wettability , surface free energy and surface morphology of the eroded dentin . MATERIAL AND METHODS : Bovine tooth specimens ( N = 144 ) were randomly divided into 6 groups according to the dentin substrate ( sound or eroded ) and surface treatment ( 5% P Chi , 5 mol/L EDC or no biomodification ( control ) ) . Half of the specimens ( n = 72 ) were submitted to erosive challenge by immersion in 3% citric acid ( pH 2 ) for 2 h . For the surface wettability analysis ( n = 12 ) , the contact angles between the dentin surface and the 3M Scotchbond Universal adhesive were measured with a goniometer . For the surface free energy analysis ( n = 3 ) , the contact angles between the dentin surface and 3 organic solvents of distinct polarities ( water , formamide and diiodomethane ) were recorded . Surface morphology ( n = 3 ) was analyzed with the use of scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . The data was statistically analyzed using the two way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) ( alpha = 05 ) . RESULTS : Neither 5% P Chi nor 5 mol/L EDC influenced the dentin surface wettability ( p > 05 ) . Surface free energy decreased in the eroded substrate after biomodification with EDC ( p < 05 ) . Biomodification with P Chi demineralized the dentin surface and increased the dentin tubule embouchure . CONCLUSIONS : It can be concluded that 5% P Chi and 5 mol/L EDC did not impact the surface wettability of the eroded dentin . However , EDC promoted lower surface free energy , while P Chi altered surface morphology , causing demineralization and the opening of dentin tubules . FAU Ururahy , Mirian Saavedra Lopes
NORHA , a long non coding RNA ( lncRNA ) , serves as a key inducer of follicular atresia in sows by triggering granulosa cells ( GCs ) apoptosis . However , its regulation by N6 methyladenosine ( m6A ) the most abundant RNA modification remains unresolved . This study identified NORHA as a functional target of the m6A reader HNRNPA2B1 in sow GCs ( sGCs ) . Transcriptome wide mapping of RNA modification sites revealed extensive m6A enrichment on NORHA , with HNRNPA2B1 binding directly to the transcript and enhancing its stability via modification of multiple m6A sites , including A261 , A441 , and A HNRNPA2B1 suppressed 17beta estradiol ( E2 ) biosynthesis and promoted sGC apoptosis by activating the NORHA FoxO1 axis . FoxO1 subsequently repressed expression of cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 ( CYP19A1 ) , which encodes the enzyme essential for E2 biosynthesis . Additionally , HNRNPA2B1 functioned as a critical mediator of METTL3 dependent m6A modification , modulating NORHA expression and activity in sGCs . This study highlights an important m6A dependent regulatory mechanism governing NORHA expression in sGCs . FAU Zhou , Chun Xue
Chorionic gonadotropin alpha ( Cgalpha ) functions as the shared subunit for thyroid stimulating hormone subunit beta ( Tshbeta ) , luteinizing hormone subunit beta ( Lhbeta ) , and follicle stimulating hormone subunit beta ( Fshbeta ) . While these beta subunits have been extensively studied using effective gene knockout models in zebrafish , the biological role of Cgalpha remains elusive . In this study , cgalpha deficient zebrafish generated via transcription activator like effector nucleases ( TALENs ) exhibited viability but displayed pronounced developmental abnormalities , including growth retardation , hyperpigmentation , reduced thyroxine ( T4 ) levels , and defective anterior swim bladder inflation during juvenile stages . In adults , cgalpha deficiency led to disrupted gonadal development , impaired secondary sex characteristics ( SSCs ) , and severely impacted reproductive behavior in both female and male fish . Notably , both testicular and ovarian differentiation were observed in cgalpha deficient fish and lhbeta ( / ) ; fshbeta ( / ) mutants . Gonadal sex differentiation in cgalpha deficient zebrafish exhibited a pronounced shift toward testicular fate upon additional disruption of fshbeta ( cgalpha ( / ) ; fshbeta ( / ) ) , marked by elevated anti Mullerian hormone ( amh ) expression , or following loss of follicle stimulating hormone receptor ( fshr ) ( cgalpha ( / ) ; fshr ( / ) ) . In vitro assays in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells revealed increased cAMP response element ( CRE ) promoter activity following transfection with constructs encoding Fshr , Fshbeta/Fshr , or Cgalpha/Fshbeta/Fshr . Collectively , the phenotypes observed in cgalpha deficient fish recapitulate those of thyrotropin and gonadotropin disrupted models , highlighting the essential role of Cgalpha in thyroid and gonadal function . Importantly , these findings uncover the role of Fsh signaling in maintaining proper ovarian differentiation in zebrafish , including Cgalpha independent Fshbeta activity and the constitutive functionality of Fshr .

Pentadactyl limbs represent a conserved morphological feature among tetrapods , with anterior digits considered more important than posterior digits for refined movement . While posterior digit formation is governed by graded expression of the Shh and 5 ' Hox genes , the regulatory mechanisms underlying anterior digit development , especially digit I ( DI ) , remain poorly defined . This study identified an anterior expression pattern of Zic3 in the limb buds of representative tetrapods , including humans , which exerted an inhibitory effect on skeletal development . Zic3 was highly expressed in the anterior region of limb buds at early developmental stages , with species specific divergence emerging during later development . Overexpression of Zic3 significantly delayed chondrogenesis and ossification , leading to bone shortening but not loss . Furthermore , RNA sequencing demonstrated that Zic3 down regulated key genes associated with skeletal development , including Cytl1 , Sox9 , Ihh , Ptch1 , Runx2 , and Wnt These findings demonstrate that Zic3 acts as a conserved inhibitor of anterior skeletal maturation and contributes to the molecular asymmetry of tetrapod limb development .

Vertebrate limbs have undergone profound morphological diversification , enabling adaptations to a broad spectrum of ecological niches . In marine mammals , the evolution of highly specialized flipper like forelimbs represents a profound structural transformation associated with aquatic habitats . This adaptation has been hypothesized to result , in part , from the inhibition of interphalangeal cell apoptosis during limb development , although the underlying genetic mechanism remains poorly understood . This study investigated the evolutionary dynamics and functional consequences of three key bone morphogenetic protein genes , BMP2 , BMP4 , and BMP7 , which regulate apoptosis in interphalangeal mesenchymal stromal cells during embryonic limb development to ensure proper differentiation of interphalangeal tissues . Comparative genomic analysis revealed significantly accelerated evolution for BMP4 and BMP7 in the cetacean ancestral lineage , with two positively selected sites ( V79I and H247R ) involved in cetacean specific amino acid substitutions located in the TGF beta propeptide functional domain in BMP In vitro assays confirmed that cetacean specific BMP4 mutations significantly disrupted normal cell apoptosis and proliferation and altered the transcription and protein expression of downstream apoptosis related factors , including cytochrome c ( Cyt c ) , BCL2 associated X , and B cell lymphoma 2 , within the BMP signaling pathway . The significant influence of BMP4 mutations on apoptotic inhibition highlights a potential role in the development of limb bud mesenchymal tissue and the emergence of the flipper forelimb phenotype in cetaceans .

The transition to menopause is marked by a gradual decrease of estradiol . Concurrently , the risk of dementia in women increases around menopause , suggesting that estradiol ( or the lack thereof ) plays a role in the development of dementia and other age related neuropathologies . Here , we set out to investigate whether there is a link between brain aging and estradiol associated events , such as menarche and menopause . For this purpose , we applied a well validated machine learning approach to analyze both cross sectional and longitudinal data from a sample of 1 , 006 postmenopausal women who underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging twice , approximately 2 years apart . We observed less brain aging in women with an earlier menarche , a later menopause , and a longer reproductive span ( i . e . , the time interval between menarche and menopause ) . These effects were evident both cross sectionally and longitudinally , supporting the notion that estradiol has neuroprotective properties and contributes to brain preservation . However , further research is required because the observed effects were small , estradiol was not directly measured , and other factors may modulate female brain health . Future studies might benefit from incorporating actual estradiol ( and other hormone ) measures , as well as considering genetic predispositions and lifestyle factors alongside indicators of brain aging to deepen our understanding of estradiol ' s role in maintaining brain health . Additionally , including more diverse study populations ( e . g . , varying in ethnicity , socioeconomic status , and health status ) in follow up research would enhance the generalizability and applicability of these findings .
AIM : As earlier puberty has been associated with higher later metabolic risk , we studied how weight gain in infancy and childhood is associated with pubertal timing and duration in healthy children . METHOD : Leveraging the longitudinal data from the Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project study , we used linear regression analyses to investigate how weight gain in different age intervals during infancy and childhood is associated with the onset , culmination and duration of puberty in 230 boys and 278 girls . RESULTS : For girls , a 1 standard deviation ( SD ) greater weight gain in infancy and childhood predicted earlier onset of breast development and earlier menarche by approximately 3 4 months . For boys , a 1 SD greater weight gain in infancy and childhood predicted earlier start and culmination of genital development according to Tanner stages by approximately 2 months . Greater weight gain in infancy and childhood seems to lengthen the duration of puberty in girls by 1 2 months , but is not associated with the duration of puberty in boys . CONCLUSIONS : Weight gain in infancy and childhood was associated with the timing of puberty in both boys and girls .
Transcription machineries play key roles in nature by regulating diverse cellular processes , including cell cycle progression , the control of intracellular metabolic balance , and cell differentiation and growth . These processes are regulated by the programmed transcription factor mediated operation of transcription machineries and cellular environmental cues dictating spatiotemporal gene expression , demonstrating amplification and bistable , switchable , and transient dynamic features . Emulating these native pathways through artificial means not only advances the area of Systems Chemistry by providing principles for the evolution of life but also introduces novel catalytic and theranostic applications of the system . The perspective addresses recent advances in developing transcription machinery loaded protocell assemblies , consisting of liposomes , microdroplets , proteinsomes , and microcapsules . Stimuli responsive transcription machineries integrated into liposomes , Fe ( 3+ ) cross linked tannic acid membranes , and nucleic acid functionalized hydrogel microcapsules acting as protocells are triggered by light , redox agents , and switchable refiguration of transcription templates . Moreover , temporally modulated oscillatory transcription circuitries integrated in microemulsion droplets acting as protocells were demonstrated , and the transcription guided transient assembly and disassembly of DNA nanotubes mimicking formation and dissociation of motor filaments in native cells was accomplished . In addition , the dynamic transcription mediated diffusive signaling and communication of microdroplets and proteinosome based protocell assemblies are presented . Future challenges of the topic and potential practical applications of these systems are addressed in the conclusion section . FAU Dong , Jiantong
Bacteriophages ( phages ) and bacteria within the gut microbiome persist in long term stable coexistence . These interactions are driven by eco evolutionary dynamics , where bacteria employ a variety of mechanisms to evade phage infection , while phages rely on counterstrategies to overcome these defenses . Among the most abundant phages in the gut are the crAss like phages that infect members of the order Bacteroidales , in particular , genus Bacteroides . In this study , we explored some of the mechanisms enabling the co existence of four phage Bacteroidales host pairs in vitro using a multi omics approach ( transcriptomics , proteomics and metabolomics ) . These included three Bacteroides species paired with three crAss like phages ( Bacteroides intestinalis and small ef , CyrilliccrAss001 , Bacteroides xylanisolvens and small ef , CyrilliccrAss002 , and an acapsular mutant of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron with DAC15 ) , and Parabacteroides distasonis paired with the siphovirus small ef , CyrillicPDS We show that phase variation of individual capsular polysaccharides ( CPSs ) is the primary mechanism promoting phage co existence in Bacteroidales , but this is not the only strategy . Alternative resistance mechanisms , while potentially less efficient than CPS phase variation , can be activated to support bacterial survival by regulating gene expression and resulting in metabolic adaptations , particularly in amino acid degradation pathways . These mechanisms , also likely regulated by phase variation , enable bacterial populations to persist in the presence of phages , and vice versa . An acapsular variant of B . thetaiotaomicron demonstrated broader transcriptomic , proteomic , and metabolomic changes , supporting the involvement of additional resistance mechanisms beyond CPS variation . This study advances our understanding of long term phage host interaction , offering insights into the long term persistence of crAss like phages and extending these observations to other phages , such as small ef , CyrillicPDS Knowledge of the complexities of phage bacteria interactions is essential for designing effective phage therapies and improving human health through targeted microbiome interventions .

Although significant advances have been achieved in the biofortification of common beans to overcome deficiencies in Zinc ( Zn ) and iron ( Fe ) , the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood . We thus explored the relationships between phosphorus nutrition and Zn and Fe accumulation in four bean genotypes ( Edar , Nizok , Colorado and Chimbolos ) that nominally show differences in seed Fe and Zn accumulation . In contrast to other genotypes , while phosphorus availability had no effect on seed Fe accumulation , phosphorus and phytate levels were decreased in all lines under phosphorus deficiency . Edar plants had a higher seed yield under low phosphorus conditions than the other lines . Analysis of the seed proteome also revealed that Edar is highly resistant to phosphorus deficiency , with similar seed Fe accumulation but lower phytate levels . The phytic acid to Fe molar ratios in Edar seeds produced under low phosphorus nutrition were only twice those of the low phytic acid ( lpa ) beans that have a 90% lower phytic acid content compared to conventional beans . Proteome analysis revealed that sucrose metabolism and phosphate cycling are shifted in the lpa beans . We conclude that a tolerance to phosphate deficiency , particularly in terms of regulation of phosphate cycling and transport pathways , contributes to decreased seed phytic acid to Fe molar ratios .

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) occurs with high incidence in Southeast Asia where almost all tumors are associated with Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) infection . Cisplatin is used in combination chemotherapy . In this study , we determined that the EBV oncoprotein , latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) , perturbs DNA damage response ( DDR ) signaling , activation of cell cycle checkpoints , and sensitivity to cisplatin in NPC cells ( HK1 ) . Hypersensitivity was validated by LMP1 knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9 targeting in HK1 EBV cells with latent EBV infection . The conserved PxQxT motif ( in CTAR1 ) and Y384 residue ( in CTAR2 ) were required for the hypersensitivity . Inhibition of ATR ( VE821 or AZD6738 ) , but not ATM ( KU55933 or AZD0156 ) , phenocopied the G1 arrest and hypersensitivity . Attenuation of DDR signaling and hypersensitivity by LMP1 or ATR inhibition was also observed in the C17 NPC cell line with restored stable LMP1 expression . LMP1 expression in NPC tumors is highly variable . Publicly available RNA sequencing data from microdissected NPC tumors showed that LMP1 expression in the primary tumors was the lowest in cisplatin treated patients that experienced recurrence . These findings could have clinical significance in stratifying NPC patients such that tumors with limited or variable LMP1 expression might benefit from ATR inhibitor therapy .
The aim of this study was to investigate the treatment effect of an artificial nerve graft produced with polylactic acid ( PLA ) and polyvinylpyrrolidone ( PVP ) by electrospinning method , in combination with rat allogeneic adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells ( rAT MSCs ) , on axonal regeneration in a rat sciatic nerve injury . A 10 mm long gap in the right sciatic nerve was created in rats which were divided into three groups and the gap was repaired with autologous nerve graft ( autograft group ) , PLA/PVP conduit alone ( PLA/PVP group ) , and PLA/PVP conduit with rAT MSCs inside ( PLA/PVP with rAT MSC group ) . At the end of the eighth week , the results were evaluated functionally , electrophysiologically , and histologically . In functional evaluation , sciatic functional index ( SFI ) was used and all groups showed improvement over time . The results were seen in the autograft and PLA/PVP with rAT MSC groups , with no statistically significant difference between them . In electrophysiological evaluation , action potential was seen in all three groups , with the best results seen in the PLA/PVP with rAT MSC group with statistical significance . Histological evaluation showed axonal regeneration in all three groups . These results show that PLA/PVP conduit contributes to regeneration even when used alone , and increases regeneration when used together with rAT MSCs .
Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) , the transcriptional template in HBV replication , is transcriptionally regulated by multiple host proteins such as epigenetic factors and transcription factors . This study aims to identify novel host proteins interacting with cccDNA and regulating its activity in HBV replication . Mass spectrometry analysis identified 129 host proteins associated with biotinylated cccDNA surrogate HBVcircle . A siRNA library screening demonstrated that knockdown of DNAJC9 , CEBPZ , and EIF3A in HepG2 cells transfected with HBVcircle reduced the levels of HBsAg and HBeAg in the supernatant . Knockdown of DNAJC9 in HBV replication and infection cell models restricted viral replication , while the DNAJC9 overexpression showed an opposite trend . DNA pull down , cccDNA ChIP , and immunofluorescence experiments indicated that DNAJC9 can bind to cccDNA in a manner independent of histones and specific DNA sequences . Dual luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that knockdown of DNAJC9 reduces the transcriptional activity of HBV promoters and enhancers . Co IP and cccDNA ChIP experiments showed that DNAJC9 can interact with histone H3 , and knockdown of DNAJC9 reduced H3 , H3K4me3 , and H3K27ac on cccDNA . In the HepAD38 or HepG2 NTCP cells , HBV replication led to a decrease in the cytoplasmic distribution and an increase in the nuclear distribution of DNAJC Histone chaperone DNAJC9 can bind to cccDNA in a histone independent manner . DNAJC9 upregulates cccDNA transcription and viral replication by increasing the density of H3 , H3K4me3 , and H3K27ac on cccDNA , thereby activating its promoters and enhancers . HBV replication may promote the nuclear localization of DNAJC9 protein , thus facilitating active transcription and replication of HBV .
BACKGROUND : Ischemic cardiomyopathy with comorbid obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with worse long term outcomes . Intermittent hypoxia ( IH ) , a key feature of obstructive sleep apnea , exacerbates sympathetic activity , hastening cardiac dysfunction and remodeling in ischemic cardiomyopathy rat models . This study explores whether targeted cardiac sympathetic denervation ( CSD ) can limit IH induced progression of ischemic cardiomyopathy . METHODS : Male Wistar rats underwent CSD , through ablation of the left middle cervical and stellate ganglions , and simultaneously myocardial infarction , via permanent left coronary artery ligation . Three days post surgery , rats were exposed to IH ( 21% 5% fraction of inspired O , 60 second cycle , 8 hours/day ) or normoxia . At 6 weeks , calcium transient , sarcomere shortening , and adrenergic reserve in response to isoproterenol ( 100 nmol/L ) were assessed in isolated cardiomyocytes . At 14 weeks , sympathovagal balance , cardiac function , and remodeling were evaluated . RESULTS : Post myocardial infarction , CSD prevented IH induced blunting of cardiomyocyte response to isoproterenol challenge and reduced cardiac sympathetic activity . In hypoxic animals , CSD reduced post myocardial infarction alterations in long term ejection fraction and mitigated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis . Transcriptomic analysis unveiled that CSD triggered biological processes related to cardiac repair and regeneration . Immunohistochemistry further supported these findings , demonstrating increased cardiomyocyte proliferation in the hypoxic group , as indicated by elevated Ki67 expression colocalized with MF20 markers . CONCLUSIONS : Our data demonstrate that CSD prevents IH induced sympathetic hyperactivity , depletion of cardiac adrenergic reserve , and deterioration of cardiac function in a rat model of ischemic cardiomyopathy . This study highlights the intricate interplay between sympathetic activity and hypoxia in cardiac regeneration and underscores the importance of managing sympathetic hyperactivity in ischemic cardiomyopathy , particularly in the context of comorbid obstructive sleep apnea .

The majority of the pseudogenes are inert in normal transcription . Their transcripts are mostly attributed to non coding RNAs that play various functions in human tumorigenicity and progression . Distinctively , pseudogene MT2P1 is universally transcribed in hepatocytes and presents a significant decrease in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The effect of MT2P1 RNA on HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis needs investigation . MT2P1 RNA was detected by RT qPCR assay in HCC tissues and cell lines , combined with the exploration of the public databases . The immunohistochemistry assay was used for testing the expression profile of E2F7 and the parental gene MT2A . The clinicopathological features of the patients were collected and analyzed . Ectopic expression of MT2P1 RNA in HCC cell lines was conducted , and the CCK8 assay and flow cytometry assay were carried out . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and Dual luciferase reporter assay were , respectively , applied to validate the interaction between MT2P1 , E2F7 , and microRNA 15b 5p . The downregulation of MT2P1 RNA in HCC is negatively correlated with dismal clinicopathological features . MT2P1 RNA significantly suppressed HCC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis . E2F7 depletion sequentially elevated the level of MT2P1 RNA and MT2A , and E2F7 was validated as a suppressive transcription factor of the MT2P1 gene . The direct interactions of either MT2P1/miR 15b 5p or miR 15b 5p/MT2A were , respectively , ascertained , enlightening the ceRNA effect of them . The pseudogene derived MT2P1 RNA is a suppressor of HCC by exerting the ceRNA effect on preserving MT2A , and its transcription is regulated by the suppressive transcription factor E2F FAU Lu , Yiquan
Circulating cell free DNA ( ccfDNA ) can be found in blood and other biofluids and is a minimally invasive biomarker for several pathological processes . As tumors become more invasive , an increasing amount of circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) is also shed into the peripheral circulation . Combined analysis of ccfDNA and ctDNA has demonstrated prognostic and predictive value in metastatic disease . However , localized tumors shed significantly less ccfDNA/ctDNA and accurate detection remains a technical challenge . To overcome this barrier , droplet preamplification has been used to perform robust multiplexed analysis of low input samples . To reduce false positives , it is essential to use a high fidelity polymerase with 3 ' 5 ' exonuclease activity . However , attempts to combine high fidelity polymerases with commercial droplet digital chemistries have had limited success . There is also no standardized method for efficient amplicon recovery from droplets . In this work , we present a method to reliably stabilize emulsions and recover preamplified templates . We systematically compared our protocol with different destabilization methods and found an average 41% improvement in recovery efficiency . We anticipate that this standardized method will increase the consistency and reproducibility of ccfDNA/ctDNA analyses . This technique could be readily translated to other low input or low biomass samples , such as urine , saliva , or archived biopsy specimens . FAU Skeen , Colin
AIMS : Bariatric surgery is a widely adopted intervention for managing obesity and improving glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . This meta analysis evaluates the impact of bariatric surgery on glycaemic and metabolic outcomes , including fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) , postprandial glucose ( PPG ) , HbA1c , C peptide , HOMA IR and fasting insulin levels . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Comprehensive search of PubMed , Scopus , EMBASE and Web of Science was conducted from inception to March Eligible studies were pooled using a random effects model to calculate weighted mean differences ( WMD ) or standardized mean differences ( SMD ) with 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) . Heterogeneity was assessed using I statistics , and publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger ' s tests . RESULTS : Thirty nine studies with 3855 participants were included . Bariatric surgery resulted in significant reductions in FBG ( WMD = 461 ; 95% CI : 740 182 , p < 001 ) , PPG ( WMD = 153 ; 95% CI : 298 007 , p < 001 ) and HbA1c levels ( WMD = 085 ; 95% CI : 561 608 , p < 001 ) . Modest but non significant improvements were observed in C peptide ( SMD = 358 ; 95% CI : 043 to 759 , p = 075 ) and fasting insulin ( SMD = 593 ; 95% CI : 392 to 577 , p = 104 ) . Significant reductions in HOMA IR levels ( WMD = 480 ; 95% CI : 010 950 , p = 009 ) were noted . High heterogeneity was observed across most outcomes . Publication bias was detected for FBG and HbA1C , while it was undetected for the rest of the outcomes . CONCLUSIONS : Bariatric surgery significantly improves glycaemic and metabolic outcomes in obese patients with T2DM . These findings support its integration into diabetes management pathways , offering a promising approach for long term disease control and complication reduction . Further research is needed to evaluate long term outcomes and mechanisms .
BACKGROUND : In the era of precision medicine , cardiac multimodality imaging plays a vital role in diagnosing , managing , and monitoring pericarditis . This condition , often marked by inflammation and recurrent episodes , requires precise imaging techniques to guide diagnosis and therapeutic decisions . METHODS : We carefully reviewed the medical literature for high quality data regarding the use of multimodality imaging in pericarditis and the precious value of the novel concept of imaging guided therapy . RESULTS : While echocardiography remains the cornerstone for detecting pericardial effusion and evaluating hemodynamics , its limited ability to characterize inflammation has driven the use of advanced modalities such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) , cardiac computed tomography ( CT ) , and positron emission tomography ( PET ) . CMR offers superior visualization of pericardial inflammation through late gadolinium enhancement , aiding in identifying patients who may benefit from targeted anti inflammatory therapies . CT imaging , with its high spatial resolution , aids in detecting pericardial calcifications and thickening , particularly in constrictive pericarditis . PET , often combined with CT , is a valuable tool for quantifying metabolic activity , allowing the detection of active inflammation , particularly in complex or refractory cases . Multiple imaging targets have been identified as essential biomarkers to confirm the inflammatory phenotype , assess treatment response , and monitor for complications . CONCLUSION : Considering the inherent limitations of each imaging modality , the integration of imaging findings with clinical and biomarker data may aid clinicians in tailoring therapy according to different clinical scenarios and better stratification of patients who may benefit from IL 1 blockade . This review explores the valuable role of cardiac multimodality imaging guided therapy in managing pericarditis .
The antiviral enzyme cholesterol 25 hydroxylase ( CH25H ) and its metabolite 25 hydroxycholesterol ( 25HC ) , which modulates cholesterol metabolism during infection , have been associated with vascular pathology . Viral infections have been linked to intracerebral haemorrhage ( ICH ) risk , but the molecular mechanisms leading to ICH via antiviral responses remain unknown . We hypothesised that the CH25H/25HC pathway impacts neuroendothelial integrity in the context of infection associated ICH . Using a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS CoV 2 ) spike protein induced zebrafish ICH model and foetal human SARS CoV 2 associated cortical tissue containing microbleeds , we identified upregulation of CH25H in infection associated cerebral haemorrhage . Using zebrafish models and human brain endothelial cells , we asked whether 25HC promotes neurovascular dysfunction by modulating cholesterol metabolism . We found that 25HC and pharmacological inhibition of cholesterol synthesis had an additive effect to exacerbate brain bleeding in zebrafish and in vitro neuroendothelial dysfunction . 25HC induced dysfunction was also rescued by cholesterol supplementation in vitro . These results demonstrate that 25HC can dysregulate brain endothelial function by remodelling cholesterol metabolism . We propose that CH25H/25HC plays an important role in the pathophysiology of brain vessel dysfunction associated with infection and cholesterol dysregulation in the context of ICH .
Pathological cardiac hypertrophy leads to heart failure . In this study , we aimed to explore the role of transmembrane protein Tspan9 in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure . We found that Tspan9 was upregulated in the hearts of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) , in the hearts of mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction ( TAC ) , as well as in phenylephrine induced hypertrophic neonatal rat cardiomyocytes ( NRCMs ) . AAV9 mediated overexpression ( OE ) of Tspan9 in mouse hearts augmented TAC induced cardiac hypertrophy and failure , while Tspan9 knockdown ( KD ) alleviated this effect . Tspan9 OE promotes PE induced cardiomyocyte enlargement , whereas Tspan9 KD suppresses it . Mechanistically , we demonstrated that Tspan9 interacts with p62 , a pivotal regulator of autophagy , impairs its cargo function , leading to autophagy suppression . Remarkably , the anti hypertrophic effect of Tspan9 KD was impaired when autophagy was inactivated or p62 was knocked down . These findings suggest that Tspan9 exacerbates pressure overload induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy and failure by suppressing cardiac autophagy through its interaction with p
BACKGROUND : Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease is prevalent in type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) and exacerbates hyperglycemia , but its impact on postprandial glucagon suppression remains unclear . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the association between hepatic steatosis and impaired glucagon suppression during oral glucose tolerance tests ( OGTT ) , and to evaluate the mediating role of glucagon dysregulation in linking liver fat to glycemic control . DESIGN AND METHODS : In this cross sectional study , 604 patients with T2D underwent liver fat quantification via FibroScan Pro ( R ) controlled attenuation parameter ( CAP ) and liver ultrasound . Postprandial glucagon suppression was assessed during 180 minute OGTT ( 0 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 180 min ) , with continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) in 287 participants . Glucagon suppression was calculated for early ( 0 30 min ) , late ( 30 180 min ) , and overall ( 0 180 min ) phases . Multivariable regression and mediation analyses tested associations between CAP , glucagon dynamics , and CGM derived glycemic profiles . RESULTS : T2D patients with MASLD ( CAP >/=238 dB/m , n=414 ) exhibited significantly impaired glucagon suppression compared to non MASLD controls ( n=190 ) across all phases ( all P<05 ) . Each 1 SD CAP increase independently predicted attenuated dose dependent suppression in all phases ( standardized beta=183 303 , P<001 ) . Males showed greater suppression impairment than females and stronger CAP associated dysregulation . Mediation analysis revealed that glucagon suppression mediated 9 9% of the adverse effects of liver fat on hyperglycemia . CONCLUSION : Liver fat accumulation in T2D is strongly associated with defective postprandial glucagon suppression , particularly in males , which mediates nearly one third of its detrimental impact on glycemic control . Targeting hepatic steatosis and glucagon signaling may offer novel therapeutic strategies for T2D management .
Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics ( DMPK ) plays a crucial role in optimizing peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) modulators by influencing metabolism , therapeutic efficacy , and safety . Rosiglitazone is primarily metabolized by cytochrome 2C8 ( CYP2C8 ) and CYP2C9 , with the CYP2C83 polymorphism increasing clearance , reducing efficacy , and altering fluid retention . Troglitazone metabolism via CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 generates a reactive quinone metabolite , depleting glutathione ( GSH ) , elevating mitochondrial oxidative stress , and inducing hepatotoxicity . Glitazones also undergo GSH conjugation through open ring formation , influencing detoxification and toxicity . Inflammation downregulates CYP enzymes and transporters , altering drug clearance and increasing drug drug interaction ( DDI ) risks . Ketoconazole and troleandomycin inhibit rosiglitazone metabolism by 52% and 40% , respectively , while pioglitazone inhibits CYP2C8 mediated arachidonic acid metabolism , impairing renal function . Gemfibrozil further increases pioglitazone ' s area under the curve ( AUC ) threefold by inhibiting CYP2C Additionally , rosiglitazone modulates OATP1B1 , enhancing pravastatin uptake at low concentrations but inhibiting it at higher levels , affecting plasma levels . Troglitazone inhibits organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 ( OATP1B1 ) mediated rosuvastatin uptake , reducing hepatic delivery and efficacy , necessitating strategic drug combinations . Furthermore , new PPARgamma modulators are being developed via selective and partial activation to mitigate toxicity , incorporating non thiazolidinedione scaffolds and optimizing DMPK properties through nanocarriers such as lipid based nanoparticles . A deeper understanding of these factors is essential for designing next generation PPARgamma targeted therapeutics , ensuring improved efficacy , reduced toxicity , and enhanced suitability for personalized medicine .

PURPOSE : Multi kinase inhibitors ( MKIs ) have transformed treatment for advanced radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer ( RAIR DTC ) and medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) . However , limited insight exists into management differences between expert centres and multicentre registries or clinical studies . Moreover , MKI efficacy in poorly differentiated thyroid cancer ( PDTC ) is underreported . METHODS : This retrospective analysis included 154 thyroid cancer patients ( 51 PDTC , 49 DTC , 54 MTC ) treated with MKIs from 2011 to 2024 at the Essen Endocrine Tumour Centre by a consistent specialist team . Clinical characteristics , tumour genetics , time to treatment and treatment outcomes were assessed . Cox regression analyses identified prognostic survival factors . RESULTS : In ( P ) DTC , lenvatinib showed higher objective response rate ( ORR ) ( 64% vs . 18% ) and longer median progression free survival ( PFS ) ( 4 vs . 7 months ) , especially in PDTC ( 2 vs . 5 months ) . Lenvatinib treated patients without bone metastases had higher ORR ( 74% vs . 53% ) , while higher age and liver metastases were associated with shorter PFS ( HR , 12 , p = 039 ; HR , 34 , p = 031 ) . In MTC , vandetanib demonstrated higher ORR ( 60% vs . 18% ) and longer PFS ( 1 vs . 0 months ) than cabozantinib . Vandetanib as first line showed higher ORR ( 67% vs . 25% ) and RET mutations correlated with longer PFS ( HR , 14 , p = 045 ) . CONCLUSION : Lenvatinib outperformed sorafenib , particularly in PDTC , suggesting the need for alternative treatments . In MTC , vandetanib was more effective than cabozantinib , supporting its use as first line therapy . However , the choice of MKI was determined by the treating physician . Our data highlight MKI effectiveness under expert centre management compared to prior trials and real world data .
People process concrete words more quickly and accurately than abstract ones the so called " concreteness effect . " This advantage also reflects differences in how the brain processes and stores concrete versus abstract words . In this electrophysiological study , we treated word concreteness as a continuous variable and examined its effects on ERPs across three tasks with distinct processing demands ( semantic , affective , grammatical ) . Behavioral results revealed task dependent concreteness effects : in the semantic task , reaction times were faster for words at both concreteness extremes , and the classical linear advantage emerged for concrete words . Mass univariate ERP analyses revealed distinct spatiotemporal patterns of task dependent concreteness effects . In the semantic task , we identified three significant clusters reflecting increased parietal N2/P3 like and sustained bilateral fronto temporal negativity ERPs and decreased central N400 like ERP for abstract words . By contrast , the affective task elicited an increased parietal P600 like ERP for abstract words . Moreover , results from multivariate representational similarity analysis and an intersection analysis revealed that concreteness is encoded in ERP spatiotemporal patterns from 450 ms onwards , regardless of task , suggesting its role not only as an organizational principle in semantic representation , but also as a factor influencing downstream word processing and univariate ERP concreteness effects . Our findings challenge and extend existing theories like the dual coding and context availability ones , highlighting the importance of treating concreteness as a continuous variable and considering task context in word processing studies . This approach , enabled by advanced analytical techniques , provides a more nuanced understanding of how the brain processes and represents words .
Our study aims to evaluate the repellency and fumigant toxicity profiles of 3 essential oil components ( EOCs ) namely Limonene , Menthol and Linalool against Trogoderma granarium last instar larvae . Limonene is the most toxic chemical tested . Various parameters are examined , including digestive enzymes , enzymes of intermediary metabolism ( alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ) , and oxidative stress biomarker ( esterase ) . The results highlight the insecticidal efficacy and repellent activity of three EOCs , which is correlated with the applied concentrations and the exposure time . Furthermore , the biochemical analyses indicate that the treatment significantly decreases the activity of digestive enzymes such as protease , alpha amylase , chitinase and lipase , and triglyceride levels . The specific activity of enzymes related to intermediary metabolism reveals an increase in the level of ALT , ALP and AST in treated T . granarium larvae compared to controls . Finally , EOCs also increase the esterase activity in treated larvae compared to controls . FAU Soltani , Meriem
Tropical forests play a significant role in global carbon sequestration . However , our understanding of how tropical tree species adjust to climate warming remains limited to studies on seedlings grown in pots and highly controlled growth conditions . To reduce this knowledge gap , we used a field experiment with 5 year old juvenile trees of 12 naturally co occurring dominant tropical Andean montane and lowland species growing in three common gardens established along a natural thermosequence in the tropical Andes . Based on a few previous studies , we hypothesized that montane species would exhibit a weaker photosynthetic thermal acclimation capacity compared to lowland counterparts . Our results showed that montane tree species can thermally acclimate net photosynthesis by shifting their thermal optimum ( T ( opt ) ) by 6 degrees C per 1 degrees C of warming . This strong shift in T ( opt ) was correlated to simultaneous strong shifts in T ( opt ) of apparent photosynthetic capacity parameters ( V ( cmax ) and J ( max ) ) , which increased by 7 degrees C per 1 degrees C of warming . This strong thermal acclimation resulted in similar rates of net CO assimilation between montane and lowland species across different thermal environments . At last , rates of net photosynthesis at growth temperature explained 30% of the variation in the relative tree growth rates across the two species groups and thermal environments . Our results suggest that the strong physiological acclimation of photosynthesis to warming among montane Andean tree species should be considered when predicting future impacts of warming on Andean plant communities .
Sweet potato is a vital crop worldwide , but its storage roots are susceptible to infection by numerous fungal pathogens , leading to substantial postharvest losses . In this study , a highly pathogenic fungal strain was isolated from infected sweet potato storage roots . Through morphological and molecular characterization , the strain was identified as Trichoderma hamatum , representing the first report of this species as a sweet potato pathogen . The botanical compound magnolol exhibited a strong antifungal activity against T . hamatum , demonstrating an excellent protective efficacy against the pathogen induced disease . Electron microscopy analyses indicated that magnolol could effectively disrupt ultrastructure of T . hamatum . Transcriptomic analyses revealed multiple biological pathways modulated by magnolol . In particular , magnolol could damage the cell membrane integrity of T . hamatum and disturb its energy metabolism . These findings provide critical insights for managing postharvest diseases of sweet potato and highlight the potential of magnolol as a natural antifungal agent for food preservation .

OBJECTIVE : Ligustrazine ( LSZ ) , an ingredient of Ligusticum chuanxiong , has long been used to treat neurovascular diseases in China . This study investigates its protective effects for the impairment of the blood brain barrier ( BBB ) and the underlying mechanisms . METHODS : In this study , the impacts of LSZ on the BBB function were firstly assessed in b . End3 cells in vitro . Oxygen glucose deprivation ( OGD ) served as an injury factor and western blot ( WB ) analyzed the expressions of occludin and ZO 1 , two tight junction proteins ( TJs ) , essential for maintaining the integrity of the BBB . After bioinformatics analysis of the transcriptome in vivo , qRT PCR of miR 297c 5p was conducted and a dual luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the target protein , occludin , which was confirmed by hippocampal insertion using guide cannulas and microinfection of RNA oligos . RESULTS : A 3 h deprivation of OGD of b . End3 cells resulted in noticeable reductions in the level of occludin and ZO However , administration of LSZ ( 1 muM ) effectively restored these decreases . In normal mice , administration of LSZ ( 25 mg/kg , i . p . , once daily for 9 days ) resulted in a notable reduction in miR 297c 5p . In the middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) mouse model , increased miR 297c 5p was also reversed by LSZ administration . Bioinformatics analysis revealed one of the targets of miR 297c 5p includes occludin . MiR 297c 5p was found to directly target occludin in the dual luciferase reporter assay . Transfection of miR 297c 5p agomir into b . End3 cells resulted in a significant reduction in the level of occludin , while transfection of antagomir led to an increase in occludin . Besides , stereotaxic injection of AAV miR 297c 5p into the hippocampus reduced occludin level in vivo . Ultimately , hippocampal microinfection of RNA oligos provided a confirmation that miR 297c 5p was downregulated by LSZ in MCAO mice with up regulated occludin expression . CONCLUSION : In conclusion , the present findings provide new insights into regulating occludin by LSZ through downregulation of miR 297c 5p .
Inflammatory changes in perivascular adipose tissue are associated with atherosclerotic lesions in the adjacent artery and can also be used as a marker in patient workup . While adipocyte size is known to be closely related to adipose tissue dysfunction and inflammation , it has not been widely studied in perivascular adipose tissue obtained from healthy human subjects without clinical atherosclerosis . In this cross sectional study , we addressed this issue by measuring adipocyte size and defining its relationship to cardiovascular risk factors in a healthy cohort of living kidney donors . The presence of cardiovascular risk factors was established by a standardized questionnaire , clinical measurements and body composition analyses . Adipocyte size was measured in the perivascular depot . The proportions of various macrophage subtypes were determined by flow cytometry . To confirm the results , the proportion of CD68 + macrophages was additionally assessed by immunohistochemistry . A correlation and principal component analyses were performed to explore associations . Adipocyte size in perivascular adipose tissue correlated with markers of lipid metabolism , inflammation , and glucose metabolism . Further , the positive correlation with the pro inflammatory subpopulation of macrophages suggests a strong local effect of perivascular adipose tissue . Perivascular adipocyte size was associated with cardiovascular risk factors and markers of inflammation in a healthy cohort of living kidney donors . This further supports the local role of adipose tissue dysfunction and inflammation in early atherosclerosis development and detection . FAU Bartuskova , Hana
BACKGROUNDS : 11 , 12 Diacetyl carnosol ( DACA ) , a derivative of carnosol , exhibits significant anti inflammatory and antioxidant properties . However , its antidepressant effects and underlying mechanisms remain unclear . High mobility group box 1 protein ( HMGB1 ) mediated inflammatory responses and associated neurofunctional impairments play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression . This study aimed to investigate whether DACA exerts anti inflammatory and antidepressant effects and whether its mechanisms involve the HMGB1/NF kappaB/NLRP3 signaling pathway . METHODS : A depression model was established in mice through 6 weeks of chronic unpredictable mild stress ( CUMS ) . From the 4th week of stimulation , the treatment group received DACA for 3 weeks . BV2 cells were stimulated with LPS+ATP , and the treatment group was cultured in DACA medium for 24 h . Supernatants from BV2 cells were used to culture primary neurons . To confirm the critical role of HMGB1 in DACA ' s antidepressant effects , CUMS stressed mice were treated with glycyrrhizin ( GZA ) or the DACA+GZA combination . Depressive like behaviors were evaluated using the sucrose preference test ( SPT ) , open field test ( OFT ) , tail suspension test ( TST ) , forced swim test ( FST ) , and Morris water maze ( MWM ) . Hippocampal microglial cell and primary neuron morphology were assessed by immunofluorescence , and dendritic spine density in hippocampal neurons was examined using Golgi staining . IL 6 and TNF alpha concentrations in mouse serum and BV2 supernatant were measured by ELISA . Western blotting was used to detect protein expressions of HMGB1 , NF kappaB p65 , p NF kappaB p65 , NLRP3 , and IL 1beta in the hippocampus and BV2 cells . RESULTS : CUMS exposed mice showed decreased sucrose preference , increased immobility in TST and FST , prolonged escape latency in MWM , and reduced crossings . Microglial activation and upregulation of HMGB1 , NF kappaB p65 , p NF kappaB p65 , NLRP3 , and IL 1beta were observed in both CUMS stressed mice and LPS+ATP induced BV2 cells , with reduced dendritic spine density in the hippocampus . DACA significantly reversed these phenomena . The effects of DACA were comparable to those of GZA treatment , and no changes were observed with the DACA+GZA combination . CONCLUSION : The HMGB1/NF kappaB/NLRP3 signaling pathway is involved in DACA ' s therapeutic effects on depression .
IMPORTANCE : Nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) represents the third most common stroke type with unique etiologies , risk factors , diagnostics , and treatments . Nevertheless , epidemiological studies often cluster SAH with other stroke types leaving its distinct burden estimates obscure . OBJECTIVE : To estimate the worldwide burden of SAH . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : Based on the repeated cross sectional Global Burden of Disease ( GBD ) 2021 study , the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated . Moreover , the SAH burden was compared with other diseases , and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study . The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and EXPOSURES : SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES : Absolute numbers and age standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals ( UIs ) of SAH incidence , prevalence , mortality , and disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ) as well as risk factor specific population attributable fractions ( PAFs ) . RESULTS : In 2021 , the global age standardized SAH incidence was 3 ( 95% UI , 3 5 ) , prevalence was 2 ( 95% UI , 1 6 ) , mortality was 2 ( 95% UI , 7 8 ) , and DALY rate was 2 ( 95% UI , 5 6 ) per 100 000 people . The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America , the Caribbean , Oceania , and high income Asia Pacific . Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased , especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index , all age standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021 : the incidence by 8% ( 95% UI , 7% 6% ) , prevalence by 1% ( 95% UI , 8% 7% ) , mortality by 1% ( 95% UI , 7% 3% ) , and DALY rate by 6% ( 95% UI , 8% 9% ) . Of 300 diseases , SAH ranked as the 36th most common cause of death and 59th most common cause of DALY in the world . Of all worldwide SAH related DALYs , 6% ( 95% UI , 8% 6% ) were associated with the 14 modeled risk factors of which high systolic blood pressure ( population attributable fraction [PAF] = 6% ; 95% UI , 0% 6% ) and smoking ( PAF = 4% ; 95% UI , 4% 5% ) had the highest attribution . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE : Although the global age standardized burden rates of SAH more than halved over the last 3 decades , SAH remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurological causes of death and disabilities in the world , with increasing absolute case numbers . These findings suggest evidence for the potential health benefits of proactive public health planning and resource allocation toward the prevention of SAH .
BACKGROUND : Neurodegenerative diseases pose significant health challenges in the 21st century , with increasing morbidity and mortality , particularly among the elderly population . One of the key factors contributing to the pathogenesis of these diseases is the disrupted crosstalk between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum . Mitochondria associated membranes ( MAMs ) , which are regions where the ER interfaces with mitochondria , serve as crucial platforms facilitating communication between these organelles . OBJECTIVES : This review focuses on the structural composition and functions of MAMs and highlights their roles . Additionally , in this review , we summarize the relationship between MAM dysfunction and various neurodegenerative diseases , including Alzheimer ' s disease , Parkinson ' s disease , and others . The involvement of key proteins such as Sig 1R , IP3R , and VAPB in maintaining ER mitochondrial communication and their dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases is emphasized . CONCLUSION : Through analyzing the effects of MAM on neurodegenerative diseases , we provide the newest insights and potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of these debilitating conditions .
BACKGROUND AND AIM : Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease ( MASLD ) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide . Since the adoption of the new terminology from the Delphi Consensus statement , there has not been a large multicenter cohort study of MASLD among lean versus non lean individuals . This study aims to assess prevalence and incidence outcomes among lean and non lean individuals with MASLD in a diverse patient cohort . METHODS : We conducted a retrospective multicenter study on patients with MASLD at the Banner and the University of Michigan Health systems from 2012 to Main outcomes included mortality and incidence of cirrhosis , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , major adverse liver outcome ( MALO ) , and cancer . RESULTS : Seventy five thousand nine hundred twenty one patients were included in this cohort with 5% lean individuals . In this cohort , 99% were lean , 16% were overweight , 47% were obesity class I , and 39% were obesity class II III ; 49% were female ; and 32% were non Hispanic White , 23% Hispanic , 75% Black , 71% Native Americans ( NAs ) , and 97% Asian/Pacific Islander . After adjusting for confounders , lean individuals had a higher mortality , higher incidence of CVD , and higher incidence of MALO . CONCLUSIONS : Lean individuals have a higher mortality , higher cardiovascular burden , and higher incidence of MALO compared to non lean individuals . Further studies are warranted to explore lean patients with MASLD , and interventions are needed to decrease mortality in this patient population .
ObjectiveAcute lung injury is a fatal complication triggered by sepsis , characterized by widespread inflammation and weakening of the alveolar epithelium . Irisin has been reported to exert anti inflammatory effects , which are produced by the cleavage of fibronectin type III domain containing protein 5 in skeletal muscle . Here , we investigated the potential of irisin in preventing acute lung injury by protecting the alveolar epithelium . MethodsThe sepsis related acute lung injury model was established by a cecal ligation and puncture model in C57/BL6N mice . Lung histology was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin and Masson staining . Ferroptosis related proteins and genes were quantified via western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction , respectively , whereas cytokine levels were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay . ResultsHistological analysis revealed lung injury in the cecal ligation and puncture group , alongside elevated levels of cytokines such as IL 1beta , IL 18 , and TNF alpha compared with controls . Treatment with irisin mitigated sepsis induced lung damage and reduced oxidative stress , as indicated by reactive oxygen species and Fe ( 2+ ) levels . Furthermore , irisin pretreatment inhibited the upregulation of ferroptosis related genes ( Acsl4 , Ptgs2 , and Hspa5 ) as well as ACSL4 , COX 2 , and p AMPK expression . ConclusionThese findings suggest that irisin treatment is associated with reduced ferroptosis and inflammation in sepsis induced acute lung injury . Irisin emerges as a promising candidate for acute lung injury therapy induced by sepsis . FAU Zhang , Feng
AIMS : Toll like receptors ( TLRs ) play critical roles in pain modulation and immune responses . Polyinosinic polycytidylic acid ( Poly IC ) , a TLR3 specific ligand , has shown promise in exerting neuroprotective effects , as it mitigates inflammation in several diseases . Considering that sterile neurogenic inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of migraine , we explored the impact of Poly IC on episodic migraine treatment and the potential mechanisms involved . METHODS : Episodic migraine was induced in male rats via a single intraperitoneal injection of nitroglycerin . Poly IC ( with or without a TLR3 inhibitor ) treatment was performed before migraine induction . Pain was assessed according to the mechanical sensitivity threshold , head directed grooming , and the Rat Grimace Scale . The expression of TLR3 and its downstream molecule TRIF was subsequently examined , after which calcitonin gene related peptide ( CGRP ) , c fos , and proinflammatory cytokine expression was assessed . Moreover , TRIF expression in primary cultured neurons was knocked down by shRNA in vitro to further explore the mechanisms by which Poly IC mediates migraine like inflammation . RESULTS : Poly IC treatment significantly upregulated TLR3/TRIF expression , reduced the production of CGRP , c fos , and inflammatory cytokines , and alleviated allodynia in an animal model of migraine . Moreover , TRIF knockdown blunted the anti inflammatory effects of Poly IC treatment in primary cultured neurons . CONCLUSIONS : Poly IC exerts therapeutic effects against neurogenic inflammation via the TLR3/TRIF signaling pathway in an episodic migraine model .
Epigenetic changes caused by methylphenidate hydrochloride on paternal inheritance have been suggested in fish , yet a subject to be determined in mammals . In rats , we showed increased sperm DNA fragmentation and reduced embryonic viability . In the present report , male Wistar rats ( n = 21 ) were divided into two groups : control and methylphenidate . The control group received 1 mL/kg of distilled water , while the methylphenidate group received 5 mg/kg by gavage from 38 to 68 days of age on a single daily dose . After this period , there was an interval before exposed rats started a mating schedule with untreated/normally cycling females . Morphological quality and key epigenetic marks in the blastocysts were assessed . Immunocytochemistry was performed in fresh blastocysts to quantify the trimethylated histones H3K4 , H3K9 , and H4K Treatment with methylphenidate reduced the mean quality of blastocysts by 57% ( p = 02 ) , as well as increased those classified as " poor " by more than 150% ( p < 001 ) . Epigenetic marks were also altered , with an increase in the intensity of H3K9me3 ( p = 01 ) , a reduction of H4K20me3 ( p = 05 ) and a nonsignificant increase of H3K4me3 ( p = 34 ) . The results suggest that the decline in blastocyst quality is highly associated with subchronic use of this psychostimulant by adolescent males . This is the first report showing the risks posed by methylphenidate to the epigenetic signature of a mammalian blastocyst following paternal exposure .
Inherited metabolic diseases ( IMDs ) are genetic disorders that disrupt biochemical processes in the human body , due to pathogenic variants in genes encoding enzymes or transporters . While IMDs are mostly diagnosed in infancy or childhood , there is an increasing number of diagnoses in adult patients . Delayed diagnosis , particularly in older patients , may reflect the diagnostic odyssey usually observed in rare diseases ' patients and can result in complications and reduced quality of life for patients and their families . The aim of the study was to better characterize the diagnosis of IMDs in older patients ( >/= 65 years ) . We conducted a systematic literature review ( SLR ) to examine the diagnosis and clinical presentation of IMDs in patients aged 65 and older . We searched databases like PubMed , Embase , and Lilacs for relevant studies from 1965 to A total of 260 articles were included , representing 293 patients with a median age of 69 years at diagnosis . From this SLR , 67 different diagnoses have been reported . The most frequently reported diseases were Fabry disease , alkaptonuria , Gaucher disease , mitochondrial disorders , and glycogen storage disease type V . Median diagnostic delay was 5 years with a wide range of 1 91 years . Musculoskeletal symptoms were the most frequently reported , followed by neurological and cardiovascular symptoms . Our findings underscore the importance of recognizing IMDs in older patients and the need for awareness among healthcare providers to improve diagnosis and patient care . Future guidelines and teaching programs should incorporate metabolic investigations for older patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of IMDs .
Orbital metastases from breast carcinoma are uncommon and often present diagnostic challenges . Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography ( FDG PET CT ) is widely used in oncologic imaging , but may fail to detect small or metabolically inactive orbital lesions . We report a 41 year old female with a history of hormone receptor positive invasive lobular breast carcinoma who presented with a painless progressive swelling of the lower eyelid and proptosis over 3 months . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) orbit revealed a lesion in the inferolateral aspect of the left lower eyelid and extraconal compartment of the left orbit . FDG PET CT did not demonstrate any metabolic activity in the orbit . A biopsy was performed , confirming metastatic breast carcinoma . The patient underwent external beam radiotherapy directed at the eyelid and orbital region , resulting in a favorable clinical response . This case illustrates the limitations of FDG PET CT in detecting orbital metastasis from breast carcinoma , particularly in lobular subtypes , and emphasizes the importance of correlating imaging with clinical suspicion and biopsy in such clinical scenarios .

A 67 year old woman presented with fever and a cold a week later , with symptoms of hyperglycemia . After 10 days , her non fasting blood glucose level was 586 mg/dL , and glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) was 2% . She then developed diabetic ketosis and was treated with insulin . Her fasting C peptide immunoreactivity ( CPR ) became 4 ng/mL . However , her insulin requirement was subsequently reduced . After two months , her CPR was 07 ng/mL at zero minutes and 04 ng/mL at six minutes in a glucagon stimulation test . Daily urinary CPR was 62 mg . Even though fulminant type 1 diabetes was indicated from the clinical course , insulin secretory ability improved .
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) are persistent environmental pollutants that pose significant risks to plant health and ecosystem function . Phytoremediation , using plants in combination with microorganisms , offers a promising strategy for mitigating PAH toxicity . This study investigates the role of PAH degrading microorganisms in mitigating the phytotoxic effects of PAHs on black alder ( Alnus glutinosa L . ) seedlings . Specifically , we examined the effects of three microbial strains Pseudomonas putida Trevisan , Sphingobium yanoikuyae Yabuuchi et al . , and Rhodotorula sphaerocarpa ( S . Y . Newell & Fell ) Q . M . Wang , F . Y . Bai , M . Groenewald & Boekhout on plant growth and biochemical responses under exposure to naphthalene , pyrene , phenanthrene , and fluorene . The results revealed genotype dependent variations in plant responses . In family 13 99 1K , S . yanoikuyae significantly enhanced defense mechanisms under phenanthrene exposure , evidenced by reduced malondialdehyde ( MDA ) levels and increased antioxidant enzyme activity . In contrast , family 41 65 7K exhibited stable shoot height and increased chlorophyll a/b ratio , but a decrease in soluble sugars under P . putida treatment with pyrene . This suggests a shift in metabolic priorities towards growth rather than stress mitigation . These findings highlight the complex interactions between plant genotype , microbial strain , and PAH type , underscoring the potential of microbial assisted phytoremediation . Our study suggests that tailored microbial inoculants , in combination with appropriate plant genotypes , could optimize phytoremediation efforts in PAH contaminated environments . Future research should focus on soil based systems and longer term evaluations to better understand the dynamics of plant microbe PAH interactions .
Nitrogen availability critically shapes medicinal plant quality by coordinating the " growth secondary metabolism " trade off , yet its regulatory mechanisms remain elusive in the non model species Epimedium pubescens . Through physiological transcriptomic integration under five nitrogen levels ( 0 , 5 , 5 , 15 , 5 mM NO ( ) ) , we demonstrated that moderate nitrogen ( MN : 5 mM NO ( ) ) optimally balanced biomass accumulation ( 22% 53% higher than low nitrogen [LN : 0 mM NO ( ) ] and high nitrogen [HN : 5 mM NO ( ) ] ) with maximal Icariin type flavonoid production ( 19% 34% higher than LN/HN ) . Extreme nitrogen stresses ( LN/HN ) impaired photosynthetic efficiency ( 18% 20% reduction ) , disrupted carbon nitrogen homeostasis , and restricted flavonoid biosynthesis by hindering carbon reallocation ( soluble sugars reduced by 26% 27% , starch by 30% 43% ) . Time series transcriptomics revealed distinct response dynamics : LN triggered active transcriptional reprogramming at mid stage ( 36 days after treatment , DAT ) , whereas HN responses were delayed to late stage ( 48 DAT ) . Weighted gene co expression network analysis ( WGCNA ) identified the grey60 module as a hub coordinating carbon nitrogen metabolism and mRNA processing . A tripartite regulatory network linking nitrogen responsive genes ( e . g . , EpF3H , UGT ) , Icariin type flavonoid/carbon metabolism ( e . g . , icariin , soluble sugars ) , and growth phenotypes ( e . g . , biomass , photosynthesis ) elucidated how nitrogen optimizes the trade off between medicinal quality and yield in E . pubescens . This study provides molecular targets for precision nitrogen management to enhance both medicinal quality and yield , while establishing an integrative framework combining physiological and transcriptomic analyses to investigate metabolic trade offs in non model plants .
Dhurrin is a cyanogenic glucoside found in all vegetative tissues of Sorghum bicolor , functioning as a herbivore repellent , antifungal agent , osmoprotectant , and nitrogen ( N ) storage . Dhurrin concentration is usually highest in young seedlings , where it rapidly accumulates following germination , after which its biosynthesis decreases and its turnover increases as the seedling ages . To avoid prussic acid poisoning from dhurrin catabolism in cattle grazing or foraging on sorghum , numerous research studies now focus on breeding for dhurrin free or acyanogenic sorghum using EMS ( Ethyl methanesulfonate ) mutants with a non functional dhurrin biosynthetic pathway . However , there has been limited and conflicting research investigating the role dhurrin plays as a potential nitrogen source in sorghum ' s early seedling growth , especially under N deficiency . It is plausible that the presence of background mutations in dhurrin free sorghum mutants could mask or confound how the absence of dhurrin affects early seedling growth . Using a naturally occurring ( non mutant ) ultra low dhurrin genotype and known low and high dhurrin genotypes , the current research investigated the importance of dhurrin as a potential endogenous nitrogen source for early seedling growth in simulated non marginal ( N available ) and marginal ( N deficient ) media . Dhurrin was implicated to be an N source for seedling growth from 8 to 13 days after planting under deficient N conditions . In N deficient media at 13 days after planting , high dhurrin level genotypes accumulated more seedling fresh shoot biomass than low dhurrin level genotypes . Thus , while acyanogenic sorghum will be beneficial in expanding sorghum ' s economic value , the use of dhurrin knock out mutants can prove problematic since the complete lack of dhurrin may affect field germination and stand establishment , particularly under N deficient or low N input conditions .
Oat powdery mildew , caused by Blumeria graminis f . sp . avenae ( Bga ) , poses a serious threat to oat production , yet the underlying resistance mechanisms remain largely unclear . In this study , we investigated early stage defense responses in resistant ( BY642 ) and susceptible ( BY119 ) oat varieties following Bga inoculation using cytological observations , physiological and hormonal measurements , and transcriptomic analysis . Microscopy revealed that Bga penetrates oat tissues directly through epidermal cells rather than stomata . BY642 exhibited a rapid and robust defense characterized by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) accumulation and hypersensitive response , tightly regulated by an efficient antioxidant system to prevent cellular damage . Hormone profiling indicated a salicylic acid ( SA ) dominated signaling pathway in BY642 , accompanied by suppression of jasmonic acid ( JA ) responses . Transcriptome profiling showed early activation of photosynthesis related pathways , metabolic reprogramming , and immune related networks , including MAPK cascades and WRKY transcription factors . Hub genes such as AsGSTU6 and AsWRKY50 were identified as key contributors to resistance . These findings suggest that BY642 employs a coordinated defense strategy integrating ROS dynamics , SA signaling , and transcriptional regulation , providing novel insights into the molecular basis of powdery mildew resistance and potential targets for oat breeding .
INTRODUCTION : Peucedanum praeruptorum is a medicinally critical species whose sustainable utilization is hindered by declining wild populations and insufficient cultivation systems . This study aimed to establish an optimized regeneration system for P . praeruptorum and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying coumarin biosynthesis , focusing on the roles of key phenylpropanoid pathway genes . METHODS : Leaf , stem , and root explants were cultured on MS media supplemented with varying concentrations of 2 , 4 D , 6 BA , and IBA to induce callus , proliferation , differentiation , and rooting . Coumarin content ( praeruptorins A , B , E ) was quantified via HPLC , while RT qPCR analyzed expression levels of PpPAL , PpC4H , and PpC2 ' H genes across tissues . RESULTS : Optimal media were identified : MS + 5 mg/L 2 , 4 D + 5 mg/L 6 BA ( callus induction , 71% efficiency ) , MS + 0 mg/L 6 BA + 5 mg/L IBA ( proliferation ) , and MS + 5 mg/L IBA ( rooting , 44% success ) . Adventitious buds exhibited the highest total coumarin content ( 67x callus ) , with roots of seedlings accumulating 67x more coumarin than leaves . Expression of PpC2 ' H dominated across materials ( PpC2 ' H > PpC4H > PpPAL ) , correlating strongly with coumarin levels . DISCUSSION : The study demonstrates that hormonal crosstalk ( auxin cytokinin balance ) critically regulates morphogenesis , while PpC2 ' H acts as a bottleneck gene for coumarin synthesis . These findings enable targeted metabolic engineering ( e . g . , PpC2 ' H overexpression ) to enhance yields , offering a sustainable alternative to wild harvesting .
The emergence of SARS CoV 2 has resulted in a significant impact on public health , particularly for individuals with underlying health conditions such as obesity and diabetes . While vaccination efforts have played a crucial role in reducing hospitalizations , it remains unclear whether the effectiveness of these vaccines varies among different population groups . In this study , we investigated the immune responses generated by various SARS CoV 2 vaccine platforms in mouse models with obesity and diabetes , focusing on both cell mediated and humoral immune responses . Our findings revealed diminished immune responses in diabetic and obese mice compared to healthy counterparts . After vaccination with adjuvanted subunit or mRNA lipid nanoparticle ( LNP ) vaccines , both humoral and cell mediated responses were significantly reduced in diabetic mice . Obese mice also exhibited decreased immunogenicity , albeit to a lesser extent . However , it should be noted that mRNA vaccines demonstrated strong neutralizing responses across all metabolic states , while adjuvanted subunit vaccines elicited higher antibody avidity in mice with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) and obesity compared to healthy mice . These results suggest that the impaired humoral and cell mediated responses observed in altered metabolic states may be linked to chronic inflammation associated with obesity and suboptimal glycemic control in diabetes . Understanding the impact of these metabolic disturbances on vaccine immunogenicity is crucial for developing optimized vaccines that can effectively enhance immune responses and provide long lasting protection against SARS CoV 2 , even in individuals with obesity and diabetes . By contributing these findings , we support efforts to improve vaccine efficacy in populations affected by metabolic disorders , advancing effective immunization against SARS CoV FAU Smith , Olivia A
BACKGROUND : Septic cardiomyopathy ( SCM ) is a prevalent complication of sepsis and a primary contributor to mortality in patients with sepsis . Although fatty acid metabolism ( FAM ) is known to regulate cardiac function , its specific role in the pathogenesis of SCM remains unclear . METHODS : The SCM datasets were obtained from the NCBI GEO database . Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) were subjected to GO and KEGG pathway analyses . The fatty acid metabolism related genes were obtained from the MSigDB database . CytoHubba and machine learning algorithms identified hub FAM DEGs . Associated transcriptional factors and miRNAs of hub FAM DEGs were predicted using Cytoscape software and miRWalk 0 database . The immune infiltration pattern in SCM was analyzed using the ImmuCellAI tool . The relationship between hub FAM DEGs and immune infiltration abundance was investigated using Spearman method . Hub FAM DEGs expression levels were validated in clinical samples and mouse models . RESULTS : Five hub FAM DEGs associated with SCM were identified , including Hsd17b7 , Dhcr24 , Cyp1a1 , Ephx1 and Hmgcs Immune analysis revealed significantly increased infiltrations of granulocytes , monocytes , M1 macrophage and neutrophils in the SCM group . Spearman analysis demonstrated that the hub FAM DEGs were positively associated with the infiltration of pro inflammatory immune cells . In Vivo , Down regulations of Dhcr24 mRNA and protein levels in cardiac tissues were observed in the SCM mouse group . Clinically , the plasma concentration of DHCR24 was significantly decreased in patients with SCM . CONCLUSION : This study revealed fatty acid metabolism played a crucial role in SCM and identified DHCR24 may act as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in SCM .
Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is one of the most common malignancies in the world . However , the main causes of metastasis and immune cell infiltration in CRC are still unclear . This experiment was conducted to identify the key genes of metastasis and macrophage infiltration in CRC according to single cell sequencing ( scRNA seq ) data . By analyzing the data of GSE261012 and GSE234804 in the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) database , the key node genes for the stages of tumorigenesis , epithelial mesenchymal transition , and metastasis of CRC were found . These genes were modeled by lasso regression by The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) database , and ZFAND2A was identified as a key gene for metastasis and macrophage infiltration in CRC . Finally , the specific function of ZFAND2A in cancer cell activity was explored in vitro by qRT PCR , WB analysis , CCK 8 , and transwell assay . The specific function of ZFAND2A in macrophage polarization was explored in vitro by qRT PCR , ELISA , and flow cytometry . We identified crucial gene expression in the entire process of CRC tumor progression , including tumorigenesis , epithelial mesenchymal transition , and metastasis . Ten thousand six hundred and thirty seven genes were determined as genes associated with tumor progression and metastasis . Among them , six genes were identified to be related to CRC prognosis . The results of TCGA data indicated that ZFAND2A showed lower expression in tumors and was related to a good prognosis of CRC . Overexpression of ZFAND2A inhibits the proliferation and migration of CRC cells . Additionally , there was a correlation between ZFAND2A expression and macrophage infiltration . Increasing ZFAND2A promotes M1 polarization in macrophages . Our findings provide new potential biomarkers for the metastatic mechanisms and prognosis of CRC . In addition , ZFAND2A is expected to become a potential therapeutic target for CRC .
Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) , a form of vaginal dysbiosis , is associated with numerous adverse reproductive and obstetric outcomes . Gardnerella spp . are among the key bacteria identified in most BV cases . The formation of a polymicrobial Gardnerella dominated biofilm on the vaginal epithelium is a characteristic diagnostic marker of BV . Gardnerella colonization and biofilm formation indicate a significant adhesion potential , the determinants of which remain unexplored . In this initial approach to identify Gardnerella adhesins , we analyzed the Cna protein located on the G . vaginalis ATCC 14018 cell surface as determined previously . Structure modeling of Cna ( designated Grd Cna ) revealed that the protein contains N2 and N3 domains with an immunoglobulin ( IgG ) like fold , which shows structural homology to the corresponding domains in SdrD and UafA proteins of the microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules ( MSCRAMMs ) family . A single B domain shares structural similarity with the corresponding domain of Sdr proteins . The R region is rich in PKD repeats , while the C terminal contains a non canonical LVNTG cell wall sorting motif . The cna gene was predominantly detected in G . vaginalis isolates but was absent in other commonly identified Gardnerella species isolates . The recombinant Grd Cna protein binds dose dependently to human fibrinogen but does not interact with fibronectin or collagen types I , III , or IV . Cna positive G . vaginalis cells adhered to immobilized fibrinogen ; however , recombinant Cna did not inhibit this binding , suggesting that Cna may not be a major adhesin mediating G . vaginalis adherence to this ECM component .
PURPOSE : This study aimed to compare the compositional differences and functions of microbial communities in infected root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis ( AP ) and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) using 16S rDNA sequencing . METHODS : Eighteen participants were categorized into two groups based on their health conditions : AP and AP complicated with T2DM ( APDM ) . Infected root canal microbiota was clinically collected for 16S rDNA sequencing . Subsequent statistical and bioinformatics analyses were conducted after sequencing by NovaSeq , encompassing diversity analysis , intergroup difference analysis , and functional prediction analysis . RESULTS : The core microbiome of root canal microorganisms was similar in the two groups , which mainly consisted of Bacteroidota , Firmicutes , Synergistota , Actinobacteriota , Proteobacteria , Fusobacteriota , Spirochaetota . The root canals of the affected teeth of APDM had significantly higher abundance of Olsenella_uli , Peptostreptococcaceae_bacterium _oral_taxon_113_str_W5053 , W5053 , Pyramidobacter_piscolen , Pyramidobacte , Synergistaceae , Synergistales was significantly higher than AP group ( P<05 ) . Under the condition of T2DM , root canal microbial metabolism was predominantly enriched towards functions of the phosphotransferase system , ABC system , amino acid metabolism , and carbohydrate metabolism . CONCLUSION : The microbial community in the infected root canals of APDM showed similarities to AP yet exhibited differences in certain species and microbial functions .
Klebsiella variicola is a member of Klebsiella pneumoniae complex and an emerging zoonotic pathogen . As part of the lymphatic system , the spleen plays a pivotal role in destroying invading pathogens . Various microRNAs ( miRNAs ) are involved in host resistance to pathogens . However , specific miRNAs that act against K . variicola remain unknown . Therefore , RNA sequencing ( RNA Seq ) of the miRNA profile of the chicken spleen was conducted to further clarify the host immune response to K . variicola infection . Challenge of 7 day old chicks with K . variicola strain AHKV S01 caused severe damage and enlargement of the spleen . In total , 22 differentially expressed ( DE ) miRNAs ( fold change>2 , q< 05 ) were identified . Functional annotation analysis of the target genes of DE miRNAs found that signaling pathways related to innate immunity , inflammation , and metabolism were significantly enriched . Notably , expression of gga miR 2954 was significantly upregulated in the infection group as compared to the control group . In vitro , gga miR 2954 directly repressed luciferase reporter gene activity by binding to the 3 ' untranslated regions of STAB Overexpression of gga miR 2954 in HD11 macrophages significantly inhibited expression of STAB1 , which is involved in activation of several proinflammatory cytokines . K . variicola induced damage to the spleen by over activation of inflammatory and innate immune responses . The observed changes to the miRNA expression profile of the chicken spleen elucidate host immune responses to K . variicola infection , providing critical insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies to enhance chicken resistance against this pathogen .
Bovine herpesvirus type 1 ( BHV 1 ) is a highly contagious DNA virus that causes a variety of diseases affecting the reproductive and respiratory tracts . These diseases can reduce the health and production performance of cattle , causing significant economic losses in the cattle industry . The current ELISA kits used to detect BHV 1 have long lead times and are expensive , and are not suitable for bulk testing on large farms . therefore , there is an urgent need to develop a rapid and cost effective alternative to the BHV 1 test . In this study , recombinant gD protein was expressed by prokaryotic system , and then used as antigen to immunize New Zealand white rabbits to obtain polyclonal antibodies ( pAb ) . An indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( iELISA ) based on gD protein was established for the detection of BHV 1 antibodies in clinical samples . The optimal cutoff value was determined to be 6185 using 60 clinical serum samples . This method had no cross reaction with other common bovine viruses . The developed iELISA method and commercially available kits were used to detect 60 bovine serum samples , with a concordance rate of 3% . In summary , we established a rapid and reliable iELISA method based on gD protein , which is suitable for epidemio logical monitoring of BHV
INTRODUCTION : Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) infection induced miRNA dysregulation plays an important role in gastric cancer ( GC ) and exosomes mediate the spread of pathogenic effects . METHODS : Expression of miR 362 5p and its clinical significance in GC were analyzed using data from TCGA . The effects of miR 362 5p on GC cells ' proliferation and migration were examined by using CCK 8 , EdU , transwell and scratch assays . MKN45 xenograft model in nude mice was employed to evaluate impacts of miR 362 5p on GC progression in vivo . Target gene of miR 362 5p was screened by bioinformatic analysis and verified by using dual luciferase assay . Exosomes from H . pylori infected GES 1 cell ( Hp GES EVs ) were isolated and miR 362 5p inside the exosome was detected . The uptake of exosome by GC cells was observed through fluorescence imaging and exosome mediated pathogenesis was explored . Furthermore , the transport of exosome mediated miR 362 5p via blood was examined . The effect of exosome carried miR 362 5p on hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) progression was investigated by hepatocyte ' s uptake , proliferation and migration assays . RESULTS : miR 362 5p was significantly upregulated in GC tissues associated with H . pylori infection . Downregulation of miR 362 5p in GC cells inhibited proliferation and migration in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in vivo , counteracting H . pylori induced carcinogenesis . TLE4 was confirmed as a direct target of miR 362 5p , and miR 362 5p/TLE4 axis implicated in H . pylori driven neoplastic transformations in GC cells . Hp GES EVs mediated the transport of miR 362 5p , was absorbed by GC cells and detected at elevated levels in the serum of infected mice . Moreover , Hp GES EVs were diffused to liver and taken up by liver cells , enhancing HCC cell proliferation and migration by targeting TLE CONCLUSION : H . pylori infection upregulates miR 362 5p , facilitating GC progression via TLE4 targeting . Exosome mediated transfer amplifies its effects , contributing to liver damage and potentially facilitating HCC .
INTRODUCTION : Cervical carcinoma ( CC ) remains one of the significant cancers threatening women ' s health globally . Increasing evidence suggests that alterations in the microbiota are closely associated with cancer development . However , the understanding of reliable biomarkers and underlying mechanisms during the aggravation of cervical neoplasia such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) and CC is still relatively limited . METHODS : In this study , cervical swab samples from 53 healthy controls , 51 high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) , and 52 CC patients were subjected to 16S rDNA sequencing and metabolomics analysis . RESULTS : We observed significant differences in the cervical microbiota between CC patients and healthy controls or HSIL groups . Compared to the healthy controls , CC patients exhibited increased microbial diversity , decreased abundance of Lactobacillus , and notable changes in microbial composition . Metabolomics analysis revealed significantly elevated levels of the inflammatory mediator Prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) in CC samples . Through random forest modeling and ROC curve analysis , we identified a combination of key microbiota ( Porphyromonas , Pseudofulvibacter ) and metabolites ( Cellopentaose , PGE2 ) as diagnostic biomarkers with high diagnostic value for CC . Furthermore , we found a significant correlation between the cervical microbiota Porphyromonas and the metabolite PGE2 , suggesting a potential role of key microbiota in inducing inflammation . DISCUSSION : These findings indicate that alterations in cervical microbiota and metabolites may be closely associated with the occurrence and aggravation of cervical neoplasia , providing new insights for further understanding the mechanisms of cervical neoplasia progression and developing novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic approaches .
Bacteria in the Chlamydiales order are obligate intracellular parasites of eukaryotic cells . Within this order , the genus Chlamydia contains the causative agents of a number of clinically important infections in humans . Biovars of Chlamydia trachomatis are the causative agents of trachoma and the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide , as well as sexually transmitted infections with the potential to cause pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility . Irrespective of the resulting disease , all chlamydial species share the same obligate intracellular life cycle and developmental cell forms . They are reliant on an infectious cycle consisting of at least three phenotypically distinct cell forms termed the reticulate body ( RB ) , the intermediate body ( IB ) , and the elementary body ( EB ) . The EB is infectious but does not replicate . The RB replicates in the host cell but is non infectious , while the IB is an intermediate form that transitions to the EB form . In this study , we ectopically expressed the transcriptional repressor Euo , the two nucleoid associated proteins HctA and HctB , and the two component sensor kinase CtcB in the RB . Transcriptional analysis using RNA seq , differential expression clustering , and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis shows that the chlamydial developmental cycle is driven by three distinct regulons corresponding to the RB , IB , or EB cell forms . Moreover , we show that the genes for the type III secretion system ( T3SS ) were cell type restricted , suggesting defined functional roles for the T3SS in specific cell forms . IMPORTANCE : Chlamydia trachomatis , a sexually transmitted bacterial infection , poses a significant global health threat , causing over 100 million infections annually and leading to complications like ectopic pregnancy and infertility . This study investigates the gene expression patterns of C . trachomatis during its unique life cycle within human cells . As an obligate intracellular parasite , C . trachomatis transitions through distinct developmental stages one for infection and dissemination , another for replication , and a third for transitioning back to the infectious form . By analyzing gene expression profiles at each stage , we identified key genes involved in these processes . Interestingly , our research also reveals the presence of two separate type III secretion system ( T3SS ) translocons expressed in distinct stages , suggesting their crucial roles in specific functions during the infection cycle .
INTRODUCTION : Specific antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) regimens are associated with weight gain in people living with HIV ( PLWH ) . Gut microbiota is involved in weight gain in humans and animals . Human gut microbiota can be classified into enterotypes with distinct microbial and functional profiles . METHODS : In a cohort of 118 PLWH , we analyzed the gut microbiome in relation to weight gain and ART regimen using 16S rRNA gene sequencing , taking enterotype classification into account . RESULTS : The enterotype was strongly associated with sexual orientation . Of the 67 individuals forming a Prevotella dominated enterotype cluster in principal coordinates analysis , 93% were men who had sex with men ( MSM ) , while 31% of individuals in the Bacteroides dominated enterotype cluster were MSM and 69% were non MSM . Forty nine genera differed significantly between the MSM and non MSM individuals . When stratified by dominant genus , only six taxa were associated with weight gain . Of these , five were restricted to Bacteroides dominated individuals . Among them , the class Actinobacteria and genus Bifidobacterium differed between individuals gaining more than 5% weight and less than 5% weight 1 year after ART switch . Additionally , three taxa were significantly different between 15% of individuals with the highest weight gain ( >/=3% ) and the highest weight loss ( </=19% ) 1 year after ART switch , including the phyla Firmicutes , Verrucomicrobia , and Synergistetes . Distinct functional properties in Bacteroides , but not Prevotella dominated enterotype individuals , linked to weight gain were observed , particularly for glycan and lipid metabolism . Additionally , ART regimen associated differences were observed for the phylum Actinobacteria , although this was limited to Prevotella dominated enterotype individuals . DISCUSSION : Differences in the composition and functional characteristics of the gut microbiome associated with weight gain and ART regimens were enterotype specific and relatively small compared with differences linked to sexual orientation . Due to the substantial differences in gut microbiome structure among many MSM , categorization into enterotypes is useful for identifying differences in microbiome composition associated with variables such as weight gain or ART , which may be limited to a single enterotype . This may further advance the identification of microbes that contribute to weight gain or alter the gut microbiome composition in the context of the enterotype .

Ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency causes Diamond Blackfan anemia ( DBA ) and other ribosomopathies . DBA has been linked to p53 activation and reduced GATA1 expression , but these mechanisms do not fully explain the disease . This study unveils that deficiencies in small ( RPS ) or large ( RPL ) ribosomal subunit proteins cause a p53 independent loss of ATF4 , a master regulator of stress responses and erythropoiesis , by reducing the pool of actively translating ATF4 mRNAs . This defect is more pronounced in RPS deficiencies because the loss of 40S , but not 60S , subunits cause a destabilization of ATF4 transcripts . ATF4 downregulation occurs in early hematopoietic progenitors and correlates with the severity of erythroid differentiation defects in patients with DBA . It is also linked to the de repression of fetal hemoglobin in erythroid cells , a frequent feature in patients with DBA . Our findings indicate that impaired ATF4 expression might be a primary contributor to DBA and explain the aggravated erythroid failure of RPS mutant patients .
Recent insights into the immune response in fibrosis have provided valuable perspectives for the treatment of liver fibrosis . Macrophages , as the most abundant immune cells in the liver , are key drivers of liver fibrosis . They are extensively involved in tissue damage , chronic inflammation , and the progression and regression of liver fibrosis . This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis and literature review on the mechanisms by which macrophages contribute to liver fibrosis . Specifically , we analyzed a bibliometric dataset comprising 1 , 312 papers from 59 countries , 1 , 872 institutions , and 9 , 784 authors . Keyword co occurrence analysis identified key research hotspots , including the role of macrophage subtypes in obesity related metabolic disorders , the crosstalk between macrophages and hepatic stellate cells through mechanoimmunology , emerging strategies for immune modulation targeting macrophages to promote fibrosis regression and liver regeneration , and new discoveries regarding macrophage crosstalk with other immune cells . In conclusion , this study provides a visual analysis of the current research landscape , hotspots , and trends in the field of macrophages and liver fibrosis , and discusses future directions for further exploration in this area .
In the field of tumor treatment , drug resistance remains a significant challenge requiring urgent intervention . Recent developments in cell death research have highlighted cuproptosis , a mechanism of cell death induced by copper , as a promising avenue for understanding tumor biology and addressing drug resistance . Cuproptosis is initiated by the dysregulation of copper homeostasis , which in turn triggers mitochondrial metabolic disruptions and induces proteotoxic stress . This process specifically entails the accumulation of lipoylated proteins and the depletion of iron sulfur cluster proteins within the context of the tricarboxylic acid cycle . Simultaneously , it is accompanied by the activation of distinct signaling pathways that collectively lead to cell death . Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of cuproptosis in addressing tumor drug resistance . However , the core molecular mechanisms of cuproptosis , regulation of the tumor microenvironment , and clinical translation pathways still require further exploration . This review examines the intersection of cuproptosis and tumor drug resistance , detailing the essential roles of cuproptosis related genes and exploring the therapeutic potential of copper ionophores , chelators , and nanodelivery systems . These mechanisms offer promise for overcoming resistance and advancing tumor precision medicine . By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cuproptosis , this study aims to identify novel therapeutic strategies and targets , thereby paving the way for the development of innovative anti cancer drugs .
BACKGROUND : The sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor ( SGLT2i ) dapagliflozin has been demonstrated cardiovascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . However , the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood . METHODS : We conducted an 8 week , single arm clinical trial , which enrolled 12 patients with inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy . These patients were treated with SGLT2i dapagliflozin ( 10 mg/day ) . We assessed changes in clinical parameters pertinent to glucose metabolism and risk factors of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , as well as alterations in the gut microbiota using macrogene sequencing . RESULTS : Improvements were observed in anthropometric parameters , glucose metabolism , blood lipid related indices , inflammatory markers , and endothelial cell function related parameters . Concurrently , SGLT2i led to changes in composition and functional pathways of the gut microbiota , manifested as increased abundance of probiotics and decreased abundance of harmful bacteria . Importantly , reduced abundance of Fusobacterium was correlated with improvements in various clinical indicators . CONCLUSION : SGLT2i represents a superior initial therapeutic option for T2DM patients at risk of CVD . The cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2i may be attributed to shifts in the gut microbiota , particularly the reduced abundance of Fusobacterium .
OBJECTIVE : This retrospective study aimed to investigate blood based immune inflammatory biomarkers ( IIBs ) in predicting neonatal outcomes in pregnancies with pregestational diabetes mellitus ( PGDM ) . PIV[ ( neutrophilxplateletxmonocyte ) /lymphocyte ) ] , SII ( neutrophilxplatelet/lymphocyte ) , and NLR neutrophil/lymphocyte ) values were evaluated in all three trimesters , and their correlation with neonatal outcomes was examined . METHODS : We included 82 cases of PGDM pregnancies delivered after 32 weeks . Maternal age , gravidity , parity , types of diabetes , and route of delivery were noted . For neonatal outcomes , we recorded gestational age at birth , birth weight percentile , existence of fetal growth restriction , LGA , neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) requirement , Apgar Score <7 at 1 , 5 , or 10 minutes , need for positive pressure ventilation ( PPV ) , need for mechanical ventilation , hypoglycaemia , hyperbilirubinemia and the need for phototherapy . PIV , SII and NLR values were calculated in each trimester and their association with adverse neonatal outcomes was analyzed . RESULTS : We could not detect any consistent and significant correlation between SII and PIV values and adverse neonatal outcomes for each trimester . There was a correlation between 3rd trimester NLR and adverse neonatal outcomes , including APGAR <7 , the requirement for PPV and mechanical ventilation ( p=056 , 013 and 060 , respectively ) . CONCLUSION : While SII and PIV values did not consistently correlate with adverse neonatal outcomes throughout each trimester in PGDM pregnancies , 3rd trimester NLR showed a notable association with the requirement for PPV with statistical significance and with Apgar Score <7 and the requirement for mechanical ventilation without statistical significance . NLR in the third trimester may hold potential as a predictive marker for specific adverse neonatal outcomes in PGDM pregnancies , warranting further investigation . FAU Bayrak , Ayse Cigdem

INTRODUCTION : Allostatic load ( AL ) serves as a valuable tool for objectively assessing the biological impact of chronic stress and has been implicated in dementia risk . This study aims to investigate the association between AL and all cause dementia , Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) , vascular dementia ( VaD ) , and non Alzheimer non vascular dementia ( NAVD ) . METHODS : This prospective study included 361 , 920 adults from the UK Biobank , with an observation period extending from March 13 , 2006 , to October 31 , 2022 , excluding participants with prior dementia diagnoses . AL was estimated through 10 biomarkers related to the dysregulation of metabolic , cardiovascular , and inflammatory systems . Diagnoses were based on the International Classification of Diseases , 10th Revision ( ICD 10 ) . We performed Cox proportional hazards models to assess the relationship between AL and dementia . Additionally , we conducted subgroup analyses for sex , Townsend Deprivation Index ( TDI ) , and smoking , along with sensitivity analyses . RESULTS : The median follow up period was 88 years . Over the follow up period , 6155 ( 70% ) participants developed all cause dementia , 2762 ( 76% ) developed AD , 1316 ( 36% ) developed VaD , and 3790 ( 05% ) developed NAVD . In the fully adjusted model , high AL was associated with an increased risk of all cause dementia ( hazard ratio [HR] : 269 , 95% confidence interval [CI] : 159 390 ) , VaD ( HR : 934 , 95% CI : 569 384 ) , and NAVD ( HR : 253 , 95% CI : 116 408 ) . Women and non smoking individuals with high AL were vulnerable to VaD , and the associations between AL and all cause dementia were stronger in people with high TDI . DISCUSSION : AL is positively associated with an elevated risk of dementia , underscoring its effect as a risk factor in the neurodegenerative process that provokes dementia . HIGHLIGHTS : This study estimated allostatic load ( AL ) index through 10 biomarkers . The associations between AL and all cause and cause specific dementia were evaluated . Elevated AL is a risk factor for all cause dementia and vascular dementia .
BACKGROUND : DR represents a major cause of global vision loss ; however , the genetic basis of functional homotopy , a critical neurobiological metric reflecting interhemispheric functional synchronization , remains largely unexplored . Emerging evidence suggests that DR patients exhibiting aberrant VMHC may potentially associate with distinct transcriptional profiles . These findings could provide novel mechanistic insights into the neuropathological substrates underlying DR related visual and cognitive dysfunction . METHODS : Resting state fMRI data from 46 DR patients and 43 HCs were analyzed to compute VMHC for assessing interhemispheric functional connectivity . Spatial transcriptomic neuroimaging associations were examined using AHBA , revealing genes significantly correlated with VMHC alterations . Subsequent analyses included functional enrichment assessment and PPI network construction . RESULTS : DR patients demonstrated significantly lower VMHC in bilateral LING , PoCG , and PreCG versus controls , indicating impaired interhemispheric connectivity in visual sensorimotor networks . VMHC variations spatially correlated with 4 , 000 genes ( 2 , 000 positive/negative each ) , enriched in transcriptional regulation , mitochondrial function , synaptic activity ( BP/CC/MF ) , and lipid metabolism/N glycan biosynthesis ( KEGG ) . PPI network identified hub genes ( ACTB/MRPL9/MRPS6 , positive ; H4C6/NDUFAB1/H3C12 , negative ) regulating mitochondrial dynamics , cytoskeleton , and epigenetics . CONCLUSION : This study represents the first integration of fMRI and transcriptomics to elucidate the genetic determinants underlying VMHC disruption in DR . The findings demonstrate that impaired interhemispheric connectivity in DR involves complex interactions among genes regulating neurovascular , metabolic , and neurodegenerative pathways . These results significantly advance the understanding of neurological manifestations in DR and identify potential therapeutic targets for clinical intervention .
BACKGROUND : Osteoarthritis ( OA ) , a prevalent age related degenerative joint disorder , demonstrates significant associations with nutritional status . This study examines the prognostic value of the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index ( GNRI ) in OA risk stratification among elderly individuals . METHODS : This retrospective analysis utilized seven NHANES cycles ( 2005 2018 ) encompassing geriatric participants ( >/= 60 years ) possessing complete GNRI measurements and baseline covariates . For comparative cohort balancing , propensity score matching was executed using inverse probability weighting a matched pairs design , adjusting for age , alcohol consumption , and the Poverty Income Ratio . Multivariable adjusted weighted logistic regression quantified GNRI OA associations , with restricted cubic splines ( RCS ) characterizing nonlinear dynamics . Subgroup analyses were also performed . RESULTS : This cross sectional analysis identified 656 OA cases among 3 , 120 rigorously screened geriatric participants . Elevated GNRI levels demonstrated a significant association with increased OA risk among geriatric populations , with the correlation remaining robust in sensitivity analyses adjusted for metabolic confounders . Specifically , a GNRI >/= 63 was associated with a higher probability of OA in this population . RCS analysis revealed a significant non linear relationship ( p_non linear < 001 ) between GNRI and OA risk , particularly among men and non smokers . Subgroup analyses indicated that males , Hispanic Americans , Non Hispanic Black people , non smokers , and those with a low PIR were more sensitive to changes in GNRI . CONCLUSION : Elevated GNRI was independently associated with OA prevalence in geriatric populations , demonstrating nutritional status ' s pivotal role in degenerative joint pathophysiology . The impact of GNRI on OA risk may differ across demographic subgroups , highlighting the need for personalized approaches in managing OA risk based on nutritional status .
BACKGROUND : Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis ( SANCC ) is a condition manifested by chronic meningitis induced by infection with Taenia solium . We sought to determine if there is evidence of autoantibody production in SANCC and whether local production of autoantibodies could be driven by immunogenic homologues found in T . solium . METHODS : Reactivity of pooled cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) from SANCC patients and uninfected controls was screened against a human proteome chip . Serum from 27 SANCC patients was then tested for antibodies to the 15 top screen hits using a Luciferase ImmunoPrecipitation System ( LIPS ) . Eight human proteins were further tested using CSF from SANCC and controls . In parallel , Taenia homologues were expressed and screened using LIPS . Antibodies directed at the 2 proteins with significant reactivity were then used to probe Taenia crassiceps crude antigen using a 2D immunoblot . Reactive proteins were subjected to mass spectroscopy for identification . RESULTS : Significant immunoglobulin G reactivity was seen in the CSF of SANCC compared with uninfected controls to both human annexin A8 ( ANXA8 ) and chromatin complexes subunit BAP18 ( BAP18 ) and their T . solium homologues on LIPS testing . 2D separated Taenia crassiceps soluble antigen was probed with either antihuman ANXA8 or antihuman BAP18 antibodies in immunoblotting . The antihuman ANXA8 antibody identified T . solium annexin B3 ( GenBank : AAY1 ) , whereas the antihuman BAP18 antibody identified cestode enzymes involved in metabolic pathways . CONCLUSIONS : Taenia derived annexin and metabolic enzymes contain epitopes that likely drive local CSF antibody production that cross reacts with human ANXA8 and BAP18 and may contribute to the pathology underlying SANCC .
Background : Opioids are utilized for acute pain in hospitalized patients and carry the risk of unintentional toxicity . The relationship between unintentional toxicity within a hospital setting and genetic polymorphisms has not been fully evaluated within the literature to date . Assessment and utilization of pharmacogenetic data may be a way to prevent unintentional toxicity in hospitalized patients and reduce the need for naloxone administration . Objective : This study aimed to provide proof of concept for the comparison of allele frequencies of hospitalized patients who received naloxone for opioid reversal with lab control data allele frequencies to identify variations between groups . Methods : This single center , exploratory , pilot study enrolled 15 patients . Genotype samples were collected via buccal swab and analyzed using a custom 13 gene panel of genes which impact opioid metabolism . Genes assessed include CYP1A2 , CYP3A4/A5 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , UGT2B7 , UGT1A3 , ABCB1 , COMT , OPRM The 15 patients were compared to an internal lab control group of 100 patients and separated into preventable and not preventable events for further analysis . Results : CYP3A5 genotype was found to be statistically significantly different between the experimental and control groups ( P = . 004 ) . This statistically significant difference was also seen in CYP3A5 phenotypes ( P = . 038 ) . When comparing preventable and not preventable events , a statistically significant difference was found in both the genotype ( P = . 030 ) and phenotype ( P = . 029 ) of CYP2C Other assessed risk factors included mean MME in the 24 hours preceding naloxone being higher among preventable events and hospital or emergency department admission percent risk being higher among not preventable events . Conclusion : Factors other than pharmacogenetics , including opioid route of administration , medication formulation , and overall hospital admission risk , may play an additive role in unintentional toxicity risk . Future research of genotype guided opioid dosing in pain management services further adds to calculating the risk of unintentional opioid related adverse effects with standard dosing of this drug class .
Endophytic fungi belonging to the Aspergillus genus have received substantial attention due to their notable secondary metabolic potential . In this study , chemical investigations using LC MS/MS based molecular networking on the endophytic fungus Aspergillus japonicus TE 739D led to the discovery of two new cyclohexadepsipeptides , namely japonamides C and D , along with three known cyclodipeptides ( 3 5 ) . Their structures , including the absolute configurations of the amino acid residues , were elucidated through spectroscopic data analysis and an optimized Marfey ' s method . The newly discovered compounds , japonamides C and D , were screened for broad spectrum cell proliferation inhibitory activity against 20 different human cell lines . The results indicated that both compounds displayed broad spectrum antiproliferative activity against MKN 45 , HCT116 , TE 1 , 5 , 637 , CAL 62 , and A 637 cells , with inhibition rates ranging from 0 to 3% . Moreover , the antibacterial activity of compounds 1 5 against two Gram positive bacteria and two Gram negative bacteria was also evaluated .

BACKGROUND : Community acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) represents a significant public health concern due to its widespread prevalence and substantial healthcare costs . This study was to utilize an integrated proteomic and metabolomic approach to explore the mechanisms involved in severe CAP . METHODS : We integrated proteomics and metabolomics data to identify potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of severe CAP . Plasma samples were collected from 46 CAP patients ( including 27 with severe CAP and 19 with non severe CAP ) and 19 healthy controls upon admission . A comprehensive analysis of the combined proteomics and metabolomics data was then performed to elucidate the key pathological features associated with CAP severity . RESULTS : The proteomic and metabolic signature was markedly different between CAPs and healthy controls . Pathway analysis of changes revealed complement and coagulation cascades , ribosome , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) signaling pathway and lipid metabolic process as contributors to CAP . Furthermore , alterations in lipid metabolism , including sphingolipids and phosphatidylcholines ( PCs ) , and dysregulation of cadherin binding were observed , potentially contributing to the development of severe CAP . Specifically , within the severe CAP group , sphingosine 1 phosphate ( S1P ) and apolipoproteins ( APOC1 and APOA2 ) levels were downregulated , while S100P level was significantly upregulated . CONCLUSION : The combined proteomic and metabolomic analysis may elucidate the complexity of CAP severity and inform the development of improved diagnostic tools .
BACKGROUND : Currently , there are no established tumor derived metabolic biomarkers in clinical practice that can simultaneously differentiate among nontumorous brain tissues , isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) wild type glioblastomas ( GBMs ) , and IDH mutant GBMs , or accurately predict patient survival . The aim of this study was to identify GBM biomarkers for molecular classification and survival prediction via nontargeted metabolomics . METHODS : Brain tissue samples from nontumors , IDH mutant GBMs , and IDH wild type GBMs were analyzed via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC MS ) . Metabolites for molecular classification and survival prediction were identified via sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis ( sPLS DA ) and extreme gradient boosting ( XGBoost ) models , respectively . Both sets of metabolites were then validated via bootstrap resampling . The biomarkers for survival prediction were further validated using an independent metabolomics dataset . RESULTS : In total , 185 human derived metabolites were identified with high confidence levels . Two non overlapping sets of 11 candidate biomarkers for molecular subtyping and survival prediction were screened out . In the validation models for molecular subtyping , the random forest model achieved the highest accuracy ( 787 , 95% CI : 780 795 ) and a Kappa value of The Cox proportional hazards regression model established based on cholic acid and citrulline had an AUC of 942 ( 95% CI : 920 956 ) at 84 days and an AUC of 812 ( 95% CI : 746 826 ) at 297 days . CONCLUSION : This exploratory study identified potential metabolic biomarkers for GBM subtyping and prognosis prediction . However , further validation in large scale clinical studies and mechanistic investigations are needed to confirm their applicability and reliability .
BACKGROUND : Non alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is strongly linked with metabolic syndrome and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases ( ASCVDs ) . This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using brachial ankle pulse wave velocity ( baPWV ) , a non invasive technique , to monitor atherosclerosis ( AS ) in NAFLD patients and to evaluate the AS risk in various sub populations of NAFLD patients . MATERIALS AND METHODS : A cross sectional study was conducted with 4 , 844 participants , enrolled from January 1 , 2019 , to December 31 , 2021 , at the Physical Examination Center of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University . Participants were aged 18 to 88 years . According to the main points of the ultrasonic diagnosis of NAFLD , the ultrasonic image report was made for the subjects . AS is defined as baPWV >/= 1 , 400 cm/s . We used multiple logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between NAFLD and AS , and multiple linear regression analysis to explore the correlation between NAFLD and baPWV by modeling . Subgroup analysis was performed based on age and gender to adjust for confounding bias and complete sensitivity analysis . RESULTS : The prevalence of NAFLD was 3% in all participants , with 4% in men and 1% in women . Among the overall NAFLD population and male NAFLD patients , baPWV exceeded the diagnostic threshold for AS ( 1 , 70 +/ 51 , 1 , 71 +/ 13 ) starting from the 45 55 age group . Through the analysis of the age baPWV scatter plots and fitted lines , along with sensitivity analysis , it is recommended that male patients should start monitoring at 46 years old for AS using baPWV , while female patients should begin at 51 years old . NAFLD was associated with increased odds of AS ( OR : 206 , 95% CI [021 423] , P = 027 ) after adjusting for confounders . NAFLD was independently positively correlated with baPWV ( Model 2 : beta = 086 , DeltaR = 006 , P < 001 ; Model 3 : beta = 05 , P < 001 ) . This positive correlation was also observed in both males and females ( male : Model 2 : beta = 081 , DeltaR = 005 , P < 001 ; Model 3 : beta = 052 , P = 001 ; female : Model 2 : beta = 088 , DeltaR = 006 , P < 001 ; Model 3 : beta = 042 , P = 02 ) . CONCLUSION : NAFLD demonstrated an independent association with AS assessed via baPWV , an accessible non invasive tool for early AS evaluation . Regular baPWV monitoring is recommended for NAFLD patients > 45 years , with males and females initiating surveillance at 46 and 51 years , respectively . Study limitations , including potential biases in NAFLD diagnosis , gender distribution imbalances , and confounding variable interdependencies , necessitate further stratified population analyses .
INTRODUCTION : The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a 3 year swimming training programme on body fat measurements in adolescent girls , without prior selection . METHOD : Two groups of 10 year old girls were analysed at the beginning of the study ( 4th grade in primary school ) . The experimental group consisted of 14 swimmers ( body mass : 99 +/ 77 kg ; height : 00 +/ 05 cm ) . The control group consisted of 14 girls ( body mass : 93 +/ 02 kg ; height : 55 +/ 88 cm ) who only participated in mandatory physical education classes . The study was conducted over a period of 3 years , with measurements taken every 6 months . Body fat was measured through the thickness of skinfolds at four anatomical locations : above the biceps ; above the triceps ; below the lower angle of the scapula ; and above the superior iliac crest . Based on these measurements , the percentage of body fat was calculated . RESULTS : Statistical analysis revealed that despite the lack of initial selection , there was no significant difference in the percentage of body fat between the experimental and control groups at the start of the study 62% vs 85% . This difference persisted until the final measurement after 3 years , at which point it became statistically significant 31% vs 14% ( F = 44 , p < 05 ) . DISCUSSION : Our findings indicate that 3 years of swimming training in adolescent girls resulted in a reduction in fat tissue growth across all four measurement sites . Initially , body fat percentage had a strong negative impact on VO max , particularly in the experimental group . However , this effect diminished in both groups over the course of the study . CONCLUSION : Swimming may be an effective means of preventing obesity . Coaches should consider a slim physique in swimming candidates .
Aim : Data on the impact of metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease ( MAFLD ) on diabetes complications in youth with type 1 diabetes are lacking . However , MAFLD is well known to contribute to cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) in people with type 2 diabetes . We aimed to investigate markers of MAFLD in youth with type 1 diabetes and their relationship with chronic complications . Methods : A prospective study of 102 adolescents ( mean age 7 +/ 9 years ) with type 1 diabetes underwent repeated annual diabetes complications assessments , including annual measures of liver enzymes . Early cardiac autonomic nerve dysfunction ( CAN ) was defined as >/=1 abnormality in seven heart rate variability parameters derived from a 10 min resting electrocardiogram . Multivariate generalized estimating equations explored predictors of CAN and other microvascular complications ( retinopathy and early kidney dysfunction ) . Results : After a median follow up of 5 years ( IQR 7 6 ) , there were significant increases in the mean alanine transaminase level ( ALT ) and systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) percentiles . Upper ALT and gamma glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) tertiles ( T3 vs . T1 2 : odds ratio [OR] , 95% confidence interval [CI] , 05 [20 , 48] , and 99 [61 , 58] , respectively ) predicted CAN development ( 23% , n = 24 ) independent of HbA1c and diabetes duration . They were not associated with retinopathy or early kidney dysfunction . Conclusion : Higher ALT and GGT associate with early CAN in adolescents with type 1 diabetes , suggesting hepatic inflammation may compound the impact of the diabetes milieu on systemic endothelial dysfunction .
To investigate whether the remission period in type 1 diabetes , as measured by insulin dose adjusted A1c ( IDAA1C ) , was affected by the COVID 19 pandemic . Data from 7603 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes from the prospective diabetes follow up ( DPV ) registry were available . We compared two time periods of diabetes onset , 2020/2021 vs . 2018/ IDAA1C and remission prevalence ( IDAA1c < 9% ) were analyzed using logistic and linear regression models adjusted for age groups ( 5 <6 , 6 <12 , and 12 <18 years ) , sex , diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) at onset , use of continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) systems , insulin pumps , sensor augmented pumps ( SAPs ) or automated insulin delivery ( AID ) systems , BMI categories ( < percentile of BMI , < percentile of BMI , <5 percentile of BMI , > = 5 percentile of BMI ) and immigrant background . Data from three time periods were analyzed : 3 5 months , 6 10 months , and 11 13 months after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes . Compared to the prepandemic period , during the COVID 19 pandemic adjusted IDAA1C was significantly higher at 3 5 months after diagnosis ( mean estimated differences 26 [95% confidence interval 17 ; 35] , p < 001 ) , but not at 6 10 months and 11 13 months after diagnosis ( mean estimated difference 08 [ 01 ; 17] , p=07 ; and 03 [ 12 ; 07] , p=60 ) , reflecting a lower percentage of patients in remission at 3 5 months . Reasons may be changes in autoimmune progression during the pandemic , lack of physical activities , increased stress or psychological burden , or altered access to care with delayed diagnosis of diabetes . Underlying causes need to be evaluated in future studies .
The Canadian Prairie Pothole Region is a notable hotspot for cyanobacteria dominated lakes . This study found minor variations in cyanobacterial genera across these lakes yet observed significant differences in standing biomass , as the lakes ranged from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic classifications . A correlational analysis of nutrients , specifically total phosphorus ( TP ) and total nitrogen ( TN ) revealed that the limiting nutrients varied considerably across the region . Of the lakes studied , cyanobacterial biomass was P limited in 21 lakes , N limited in 3 lakes , and co limited by both P and N in 23 lakes . Surprisingly , in 32 lakes , the biomass was limited by neither P nor N . In these lakes , iron ( Fe ) emerged as the most likely limiting nutrient , given a relatively narrow range of free ferric Fe ( pFe ) between 18 and Cyanobacteria can create biomass under Fe stress by producing Fe scavenging siderophores that target pFe . However , in neither P nor N limited lakes , there was a lack of correlation between siderophore concentrations and cyanobacterial biomass ( r = 05 ) , indicating that the siderophores were unable to scavenge Fe and thereby utilize the available P and N to produce further cyanobacterial biomass . Our findings suggest that these Fe starved eutrophic lakes exhibited a paradox of slow growing yet high cyanobacterial biomass , challenging the notion that only oligotrophic lakes embody slow growing metabolisms . Overall , our study highlights the importance of considering nutrient limitations on cyanobacterial growth and incorporating macro ( P and N ) and micro ( Fe ) nutrient limitation considerations into existing nutrient management strategies to mitigate cyanobacterial dominance effectively .

BACKGROUND : The prevalence of obesity is increasing in both the general and kidney failure populations . Severe obesity ( body mass index [BMI] >/= 40 kg/m ) is considered by many centers to be a barrier to kidney transplantation ( KT ) . Obesity is typically defined using BMI . Body surface area ( BSA ) is not considered , though may also be important . METHODS : We examined post KT adverse outcomes associated with obesity defined using combined BMI BSA parameters in a cohort of adult KT recipients ( living/deceased donor ) across the United States ( Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients : 2000 2017 ) . Recipient obesity was defined as BMI >/=30 kg/m , or BSA >/=94 m in women and >/=17 m in men . We used multivariable cox proportional hazards or logistic regression models as appropriate to assess the association between BMI BSA defined obesity with death censored graft loss , all cause graft loss , and delayed graft function . RESULTS : The final study included 242 432 patients ; 77 556 ( 0% ) had obesity based on BMI and 67 312 ( 6% ) had obesity based on BSA . Compared to patients with a nonobese BMI and BSA , the adjusted risk of death censored graft loss , all cause graft loss , and delayed graft function was greatest when both BMI and BSA indicated obesity ( adjusted hazard ratio 23 , 95% confidence interval [CI] : 20 27 , adjusted hazard ratio 09 , 95% CI : 07 11 , adjusted odds ratio 58 , 95% CI : 53 63 , respectively ) ; a significantly greater risk than when BMI and BSA were discordant . CONCLUSIONS : Currently only BMI is considered when evaluating obesity related KT risk ; however , combined BMI BSA obesity may better identify individuals at high risk of poor outcomes posttransplant than BMI alone .
Succinyl CoA : 3 oxoacid CoA transferase ( SCOT ) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic sequence variants in the OXCT1 gene . This deficiency disrupts ketone body utilization , resulting in ketone accumulation and ketoacidosis . Clinical manifestations typically include respiratory distress , vomiting , lethargy , and , in severe cases , coma . This case presents the first known instance of severe SCOT deficiency resulting from a novel homozygous four exon deletion ( exons 4 7 ) in the OXCT1 gene . The proband presented at the age of 3 months with severe metabolic acidosis that was refractory to conventional management . Despite high doses of bicarbonate therapy and cornstarch , he remained dependent on intravenous glucose for weeks . Repeated attempts to discontinue intravenous glucose led to severe acidosis within 12 24 h . The introduction of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy ( Creon ) significantly enhanced starch digestion and absorption , stabilizing his metabolic condition and enabling discharge within 3 days . This case highlights the therapeutic potential of combining pancreatic enzyme replacement with cornstarch in infants under 12 months of age , given their limited pancreatic amylase activity . It underscores a potential management strategy for infants with severe forms of inherited metabolic disorders , such as SCOT deficiency and glycogen storage disease type I , where cornstarch is a cornerstone of therapy .
BACKGROUND : The American Heart Association recently introduced the concept of Cardiovascular Kidney Metabolic Syndrome ( CKM ) , emphasizing the interplay between metabolic disorders , cardiovascular diseases , and kidney diseases . Although insulin resistance ( IR ) and chronic inflammation are core drivers of CKM , the relationships causing imbalance have not been fully evaluated . Emerging biomarkers ( RAR , NPAR , SIRI , Homair ) offer multidimensional prediction capabilities by simultaneously assessing nutritional metabolism , cellular inflammation , and insulin resistance in diabetes . METHODS : This study included data from 19 , 884 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) from 1999 to The study developed novel indices ( RAR , NPAR , SIRI , Homair ) and assessed their CKM predictive value through : Multivariable logistic/Cox regression ; Restricted cubic splines ; Machine learning ( XGBoost , LightGBM ) ; Decision curve analysis . Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess interactive effects on specific populations . RESULTS : After weighted analysis , multi model logistic regression showed that RAR , SIRI , NPAR , and Homair remained strongly correlated with CKM after adjusting for various factors ( p < 05 ) , with RAR showing the most pronounced relationship ( OR : 73 , 95% CI : 07 59 , p < 001 ) . RCS curves revealed nonlinear relationships between these factors and outcomes ( nonlinear p < 05 ) . In multi model Cox regression , RAR , SIRI , and NPAR were associated with all cause mortality ( p < 05 ) , and RAR was linked to all cause , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , and kidney disease mortality ( p < 05 ) , with the strongest link ( OR : 38 , 95% CI : 98 88 , p < 001 ) . Machine learning ranked RAR , SIRI , and Homair as top predictors for CKM diagnosis . The DCA model further validated these three Lasso selected variables , showing clinical utility . The model combining RAR , diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , and age demonstrated outstanding performance ( AUC = 907 ) , offering clinical reference value . CONCLUSION : This study demonstrates significant relationship between RAR , NPAR , SIRI , and Homair with the five stages of CKM , with RAR showing the robust association .

BACKGROUND : The United Nations has recognized nutritional deficiencies as a critical health issue that necessitates urgent eradication . This study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the spatial distribution and temporal trends of the global disease burden associated with nutritional deficiencies and their four subtypes from 1990 to 2021 , with a particular focus on the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic . METHODS : This study primarily employs the most recent data from the Global Burden of Disease ( GBD ) 2021 to conduct a thorough analysis of the distribution trends of incidence , mortality , and disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ) associated with nutritional deficiencies and their four subtypes from 1990 to 2021 , incorporating detailed subgroup analyses categorized by sex , age , and region . In comparison to the GBD 2019 , the GBD 2021 update places a particular emphasis on supplementing disease burden data for the period of the COVID 19 pandemic ( 2019 2021 ) . Furthermore , this study investigates the primary risk factors contributing to disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ) linked to nutritional deficiencies . RESULTS : Between 1990 and 2021 , the global burden of nutritional deficiencies experienced a substantial decline , evidenced by a 9% reduction in the age standardized incidence rate ( ASIR ) , a 2% decrease in the age standardized death rate ( ASDR ) , and a 9% reduction in the age standardized DALY rate . However , it is noteworthy that the burden of iodine deficiency ( ASIR : 72 vs . 49 ; Age standardized DALY rate : 43 vs . 98 ) and dietary iron deficiency ( Age standardized DALY rate : 97 vs . 05 ) is considerably greater in women than in men . Moreover , in regions characterized by a low social demographic index ( SDI ) and lower income levels , the burden of diseases associated with nutritional deficiencies remains substantial . In contrast , the COVID 19 pandemic has not markedly changed the epidemiological profile of nutritional deficiencies compared to the pre 2019 period , and the global burden of nutritional deficiencies has continued its gradual decline . CONCLUSIONS : Despite a decline in the global burden of nutritional deficiencies over time , significant disparities related to gender , region , and age persist . Fortunately , the COVID 19 pandemic has had a relatively limited impact on the global burden of nutritional deficiencies . Healthcare institutions must formulate more targeted strategies aimed at alleviating the adverse effects of nutritional deficiencies on global public health .
INTRODUCTION : Weekend eating habits are often different from those of weekdays , but their impact on body composition remains little explored . This study investigates gender and age differences in weekend eating behaviors and their association with fat mass percentage ( FM% ) . METHODS : A cross sectional study was conducted on 2 , 596 participants at an obesity center in Italy . Eating habits were assessed with a self reported questionnaire , classifying weekend eating behavior into four categories : maintaining weekday eating patterns , cooking at home , eating out , and eating prepared meals . Weekday eating was considered the participant ' s habitual eating pattern as reported during clinical evaluation . Differences in FM% between groups were analyzed by ANOVA and the influence of gender and age was examined by multiple linear regression models . RESULTS : Significant differences between gender and age were observed specifically in weekend eating behaviors ( p < 001 ) . Women were significantly more likely to cook at home , whereas men , particularly those aged 18 30 years , were more likely to eat out . Women who cooked at home during the weekend had a higher FM% than those who ate out or maintained weekday eating habits ( p < 001 ) but consistency alone does not guarantee better body composition , as the quality of the diet was not assessed . Among men aged 31 45 years , cooking at home was associated with a higher FM% than maintaining weekday habits ( p = 0028 ) . Regression analysis showed that FM% was higher in females and older age groups , while eating out , being hosted , or maintaining weekday habits were associated with lower FM% compared to cooking at home ( all p < 05 ) . CONCLUSION : Weekend eating habits represent a distinct and influential factor on body composition , rather than a simple extension of weekday patterns . The results emphasize that gender and age specific approaches are crucial in dietary interventions , particularly for younger men and women who maintain structured meal patterns . These results suggest that weekends may be an important period for dietary interventions based on self reported dietary patterns , with potential implications for gender and age specific dietary interventions and broader public health strategies aimed at improving long term metabolic outcomes .
OBJECTIVE : Lung consolidation ( LC ) in pediatric pneumonia could lead to complicated clinical outcomes , yet the underlying immunological mechanisms are not fully understood . This study aimed to investigate the roles of local and systemic cytokines in the development of pulmonary complications and disease progression in children with pneumonia associated LC . DESIGN : Conducted at the Shanghai Children ' s Medical Center , this study included 169 children admitted between June 2022 and October METHODS : We analyzed levels of fifteen cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) and blood . Classification and regression tree ( CART ) analysis identified specific cytokines associated with pulmonary complications and hypoxemia . RESULTS : In children with LC , most local cytokines were found at higher levels than systemic cytokines , with no apparent correlation between the two . Notably , an elevated level of IL 8 ( >/= 6615 pg/ml ) in BALF was associated with an increased risk of hypoxemia . Additionally , elevated levels of IL 4 and INF gamma in BALF were closely associated with the development of multi segmental LC . Furthermore , elevated levels of IL 2R in BALF were significantly associated with the occurrence of atelectasis , in contrast to their levels in peripheral blood . CONCLUSION : IL 4 , INF gamma , IL 2R , and IL 8 levels in BALF are closely associated with pulmonary complications and disease progression in children with LC . Exploring targeted immunomodulatory therapies in these children may mitigate lung injury caused by excessive local inflammatory responses .
BACKGROUND : Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a biologically heterogeneous malignancy of clonal plasma cells , often progressing from MGUS or smoldering MM . It causes anemia , bone lesions , and immune dysfunction due to abnormal plasma cell expansion in the bone marrow . Neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic factors may influence MM progression by affecting immune cells and the bone marrow niche . Growing evidence points to a role for neuroimmune regulation in tumor immunity . Despite therapeutic progress , disease heterogeneity and resistance highlight the need for new strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment and neuroimmune axis . METHODS : This investigation exploited single cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA seq ) to analyze MM and high risk smoldering multiple myeloma ( SMMh ) samples , identifying 11 distinct cell types . We examined their transcriptional signatures , stemness , proliferative properties , and metabolic pathways , with particular attention to neuroimmune interactions in the tumor microenvironment . Using trajectory inference tools such as CytoTRACE , Monocle2 , and Slingshot , we traced the differentiation paths of MM cell subpopulations and identified key signaling pathways that may influence immune responses and tumor progression . RESULTS : The analysis identified four distinct subpopulations of myeloma cells , with the C0 IGLC3+ myeloma cells representing the least differentiated and most proliferative subset . These cells played a critical role in MM progression and may contribute to immune evasion mechanisms . Additionally , receptor ligand interactions within the tumor microenvironment were identified , which may be influenced by neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic factors . These findings suggest that the nervous system and immune modulation significantly affect tumor biology , highlighting potential therapeutic targets that could be exploited to overcome resistance to conventional therapies . CONCLUSION : This single cell analysis provided new insights into the cellular diversity and differentiation trajectories in MM , offering a deeper understanding of the complex neuroimmune interactions that drive tumor progression and resistance . By incorporating the role of neuroinflammation and immune modulation , our study suggested novel therapeutic strategies targeting the neuroimmune axis in oncology , ultimately contributing to the development of more effective , personalized treatment approaches for MM .
BACKGROUND : Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) presents significant health challenges due to its aggressive nature and poor prognosis from late stage diagnosis . Despite these challenges , emerging therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors offer hope . beta1 adrenergic signaling has been implicated in T cell exhaustion , which weakens the immune response in ESCC . Blocking this pathway could restore T cell function . Recent advances in single cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA seq ) have enabled deeper insights into tumor heterogeneity and the immune landscape , opening the door for personalized treatment strategies that may improve survival and reduce resistance to therapy . METHODS : We combined scRNA seq with bulk RNA analysis to explore adrenergic receptor signaling in ESCC , focusing on changes before and after neoadjuvant therapy . We identified ADRB1 ( + ) T cells through data analysis and experimental validation . Copy number variation ( CNV ) analysis detected malignant cells within scRNA seq data , while intercellular interaction analysis examined communication between cell populations . Deconvolution of TCGA data revealed key immune populations , which were integrated into a prognostic model based on the adrenergic receptor signaling pathway and differentially expressed genes . RESULTS : The adrenergic receptor signaling pathway was found in various immune cells , including T cells . scRNA seq analysis revealed increased ADRB1 expression in T cells after neoadjuvant therapy . Immunofluorescence confirmed colocalization of ADRB1 with T cells , and fluorescence activated cell sorting ( FACS ) showed that ADRB1 expression was elevated alongside exhaustion markers , while immune function markers were reduced . CNV analysis highlighted malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment , and intercellular interaction analysis explored ADRB1 ( + ) T cells ' role in immune support . Deconvolution of TCGA data identified ADRB1 ( + ) T cells , SPP1 ( + ) macrophages , and CD44 ( + ) malignant cells , all of which were prognostically significant . A prognostic model constructed from the intersection of the adrenergic receptor signaling pathway and differentially expressed genes following neoadjuvant therapy showed a significant prognostic effect . CONCLUSIONS : ADRB1 expression increases after neoadjuvant therapy in ESCC and correlates with poor prognosis . Our findings suggest ADRB1 as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for post neoadjuvant immunotherapy .
OBJECTIVE : Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a chronic autoimmune disease of mostly unknown etiology and pathophysiology . In this integrative single case study on a patient with RA , we had the unique opportunity to closely monitor the individual dynamics of endocrine , immune and disease variables during a naturally occurring flare up and subsequent medication change . METHODS : The 59 year old female RA patient collected her entire urine over 30 days in 12 h intervals ( 60 consecutive measurements in total ) . Subsequently , cortisol , interleukin 6 ( IL 6 ) , orosomucoid 2 ( ORM 2 ) , neopterin and creatinine levels were determined in the urine samples . Further , each morning and evening , the patient completed the DIARI , a set of questionnaires on variables such as perceived pain , perceived RA disease activity and emotional states . Once a week , the patient was interviewed online and had an appointment with her rheumatologist , in which several indices of RA disease activity were determined : SDAI , CDAI and DAS From these data various time series were constructed for statistical analysis . RESULTS : RA disease state increased from low to high activity during the first 12 study days . Thereupon , the medication was changed , which proved effective in reducing RA disease activity . However , the levels of urinary neopterin , urinary IL 6 and urinary ORM 2 did not show any response , neither to the increasing disease activity nor the medication change . The patient ' s daily reports on pain , RA disease activity , emotional states and body temperature , however , mirrored the course of the rheumatologic indices . CONCLUSION : This integrative single case study clearly demonstrated the importance of process analysis for the evaluation of therapeutic measures in RA . In the studied patient , urinary levels of neopterin , IL 6 and ORM 2 were not found to be appropriate biomarkers of short term fluctuations in RA disease activity . Instead , the results reported by the patient proved to be a useful tool for ambulatory and longitudinal monitoring of RA .
BACKGROUND : Aplastic anemia ( AA ) , myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) , and acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) exhibit complex pathogenic mechanisms and interrelated characteristics . We aimed to identify the common hub genes , establishing a foundation for preventing disease progression . METHODS : We selected relevant datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) database for differential gene expression , gene set enrichment , and weighted gene co expression network analyses to identify hub genes , and then validated them . Subsequent analyses included immune infiltration analysis , single cell sequencing , and cell communication analysis . We performed Mendelian randomization to screen inflammatory factors and immune cells . We used RT qPCR , Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) , and cell proliferation assays to validate the identified hub genes , their relationship with cellular communication mediators and inflammatory factors , and their impact on cellular function . RESULTS : POLG and MAP2K7 were identified as common hub genes , with low expression observed across AA , MDS , and AML . There were distinct immune differentials among these diseases , with an enhanced correlation between immune cells and hub genes as the disease progressed . Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor ( MIF ) emerged as a key mediator of cellular communication . We identified 20 regulatory pathways of immune cells and inflammatory factors across different disease stages . In vitro validation confirmed low expression of the hub genes , which were inversely correlated with MIF and inflammatory factors , though they showed no significant impact on cell proliferation or migration . CONCLUSIONS : POLG and MAP2K7 demonstrate crucial roles in the progression from AA to MDS and , ultimately , to AML . These genes regulate more than 20 immune regulatory pathways through MIF mediated communication , thereby influencing disease progression .
INTRODUCTION : Identifying predictive biomarkers for immune checkpoint inhibitor ( ICI ) treatment is critical for gastric cancer ( GC ) prognosis . C X C motif chemokine ligand 13 ( CXCL13 ) plays an important role in immune regulation by binding exclusively to its receptor CXCR However , its role , underlying mechanisms , and prognostic significance in ICI treated GC patients remain controversial . METHODS : This study investigated the clinical significance of CXCL13 and its potential immunomodulatory function in GC patients . A total of 144 GC patients from two cohorts , who received a combination of chemotherapy and anti PD 1 antibody , were analyzed . The expression of CXCL13 was assessed using immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay . Associations between CXCL13 , CXCR5 , CD8 , and CD4 were assessed by IHC and immunofluorescence . Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model . The treatment response to CXCL13 and anti PD 1 antibody was investigated using a subcutaneous xenograft tumor mouse model . RESULTS : The results suggested that patients with high CXCL13 expression had prolonged survival . High CXCL13 expression exhibited increased infiltration of CXCR5+CD8+ T cells and was associated with better outcomes . The combined assessment of CXCL13 , CXCR5 , and CD8+ T cells served as an independent predictor of prognosis . Additionally , CXCR5 and CD8+ T cells were enriched in tertiary lymphoid structures ( TLSs ) , which conferred a prognostic benefit in the presence of high CXCL13 expression . CXCL13 , in combination with anti PD 1 therapy , retarded tumor growth in vivo , resulting in increased infiltration of CXCR5+CD8+ T cells . DISCUSSION : This study identified CXCL13 as a prognostic factor in GC patients receiving ICI therapy , emphasizing its critical role in the antitumor microenvironment via CXCR5+CD8+ T cells .
INTRODUCTION : Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome ( PRRS ) , caused by the PRRS virus ( PRRSV ) , is an economically significant swine disease with extensive strain variation and limited heterologous protection . Modified live virus ( MLV ) vaccines developed by serially passaging the virus in monkey kidney cell lines have been widely used for more than 20 years . Lineage 1 virus , such as NADC30 like in China and L1C 1 4 4 strains in the United States , have gradually become the predominant strain or the dominant recombination isolate donor strain in recent years . MLVs licensed for use in the market supply low efficacy of heterologous protection ability against the NADC30 like strain , and a vaccine with improved safety and efficacy is therefore required . The method of virulence attenuation used for classical strains may not be applicable to the development of a vaccine against NADC30 like strains due to their low fidelity of replication . METHODS : Chimeric RvBJ 4 ( ORF2 4 ) SX , RvBJ 4 ( ORF5 6 ) SX , and RvBJ 4 ( ORF2 6 ) SX were constructed by substituting minor structural proteins ( GP2 , GP3 , and GP4 ) , major structural proteins ( GP5 and M ) or both in NADC30 like CHsx1401 to classical strain backbone BJ RvBJ 4 ( ORF2 6 ) SX . Animal trials were conducted to assess the pathogenicity and protection of chimeric viruses . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION : Chimeric virus RvBJ 4 ( ORF2 6 ) SX demonstrates a favorable balance between safety and efficacy , with limited pathogenicity and providing faster viremia clearance as well as reduced lung lesions in vaccinated/challenged pigs . A novel strategy for providing safe and effective immunological protection against NADC30 like strains has been introduced , with the potential for implementation in the field .
Major Histocompatibility Complex class I ( MHC I ) molecules bind and present peptides to cytotoxic T cells , protecting against pathogens and cancer . MHC I is highly polymorphic and each allotype is promiscuous , and capable of binding a unique and diverse repertoire of peptide ligands . The peptide editing chaperone tapasin optimizes this allotype specific repertoire of peptides , resulting in the selection of high affinity peptides . MHC I allotypes differ in the extent they engage tapasin . This suggests that tapasin dependent MHC I allotypes should present a less diverse repertoire that is enriched in higher affinity peptides , and which are present in higher abundance , than tapasin independent MHC I allotypes , which should present a broader repertoire containing peptides with a lower average affinity . Experimental verification of this hypothesis has been confounded by the different peptide binding specificities of MHC I allotypes . Here , we independently investigated the peptide focusing function of tapasin by introducing a point mutation into a tapasin independent MHC I allotype that dramatically increased its tapasin dependence without substantially altering its peptide binding specificity . This allowed us to demonstrate ligand focusing by tapasin at both the repertoire level in cellulo , and by using an in vitro system in which tapasin was artificially tethered to MHC I , at the individual peptide level . We found that tapasin had a greater influence on tapasin dependent MHC I molecules , and that tapasin modulated peptide selection according to peptide MHC I complex stability , disfavoring short lived peptide MHC I complexes . Thus , tapasin dependent MHC I molecules experience greater tapasin filtering , resulting in less diverse MHC I immunopeptidomes that are enriched in high affinity peptide MHC I complexes .
BACKGROUND : Breast cancer is a heterogeneous malignancy with complex molecular characteristics , making accurate prognostication and treatment stratification particularly challenging . Emerging evidence suggests that lactylation , a novel post translational modification , plays a crucial role in tumor progression and immune modulation . METHODS : To address breast cancer heterogeneity , we developed a machine learning derived lactylation signature ( MLLS ) using lactylation related genes selected through random survival forest ( RSF ) and univariate Cox regression analyses . A total of 108 algorithmic combinations were applied across multiple datasets to construct and validate the model . Immune microenvironment characteristics were analyzed using multiple immune infiltration algorithms . Computational drug repurposing analyses were conducted to identify potential therapeutic agents for high risk patients . RESULTS : The MLLS effectively stratified patients into low and high risk groups with significantly different prognoses . The model demonstrated robust predictive power across multiple cohorts . Immune infiltration analysis revealed that the low risk group exhibited higher levels of immune checkpoints ( e . g . , PD 1 , PD L1 ) and greater infiltration of B cells , CD4 ( + ) T cells , and CD8 ( + ) T cells , suggesting better responsiveness to immunotherapy . In contrast , the high risk group showed immune suppression features associated with poor prognosis . Methotrexate was computationally predicted as a potential therapeutic candidate for high risk patients , although experimental validation remains necessary . CONCLUSION : The MLLS represents a promising prognostic biomarker and may support personalized treatment strategies in breast cancer , particularly for identifying candidates who may benefit from immunotherapy .
OBJECTIVE : To identify new metabolic biomarkers associated with myasthenia gravis ( MG ) . METHODS : We analyzed 285 potential metabolic molecules from UK Biobank ( UKB ) for MG patients and identified elevated serum cystatin C ( Cys C ) . Validation was performed using laboratory data , ELISA , and clinical information from Chinese ( CHN ) acetylcholine receptor antibody ( AChR Ab ) positive generalized MG ( gMG ) cohorts . We assessed cytokines/chemokines/complements and peripheral blood T lymphocytes using Luminex assays and flow cytometry . MG relevant scores including myasthenia gravis activities of daily living score ( MG ADL ) and quantitative myasthenia gravis score ( QMG ) were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed . The correlations between serum Cys C and the ratio of T helper 1 ( Th1 ) /Th2 were assessed . RESULTS : Serum Cys C levels were significantly elevated in MG patients compared to healthy controls in both UKB cohorts and Chinese MG cohorts ( CHN ) ( UKB : 99 +/ 20 vs . 86 +/ 12 mg/L , p = 26E 41 ; CHN : 08 +/ 30 vs . 87 +/ 13 mg/L , p = 83E 08 ) . Higher serum Cys C levels were found in MG patients with high disease burden , as stratified by MG ADL score . Serum Cys C correlated with MG scores , including QMG ( R = 40 , p = 90E 03 ) and MG ADL scores ( R = 42 , p = 40E 03 ) . The ratio of Th1/Th2 correlated well with the serum Cys C ( R = 29 , p = 10E 02 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Serum Cys C levels were significantly elevated in AChR Ab positive gMG patients and correlated with disease severity and Th1/Th2 ratio , suggesting its potential as an efficient biomarker for predicting the clinical severity of MG . Future prospective cohort studies with a large sample size are expected to validate these findings .
INTRODUCTION : Patients with Diabetes are at increased risk of severe COVID 19 and death , thus , it is imperative to provide them with vaccination . AdCOV S vaccine has proven its efficacy . However , the immunological response of the patients with diabetes in Ethiopia has not been well studied . METHODS : This prospective cohort study assessed immune responses after vaccination with a single dose of the AdCOVS . The subjects were enrolled diabetic patients who were 18 years old and above and attended a diabetes clinic at Adama Hospital Medical College . A sufficient blood sample was collected from each participant , following established standard protocols . We evaluated correlations among selected immunological parameters ( IgG , IgM , CRP , IL6 , IFN Y ) and employed statistical techniques such as chi square tests , independent t tests , and Generalized Estimating Equations ( GEE ) to analyze differences between given vaccinated and non vaccinated cohorts . Generalized Estimating Equations ( GEE ) are a statistical method for modeling longitudinal or clustered data , particularly useful when dealing with non normal data like binary or count data , by estimating parameters of a generalized linear model while accounting for potential correlations between observations . RESULTS : It was found that vaccinated subjects showed significant alterations in the immune response with IgM elevation and a temporary increase of inflammatory biomarkers CRP and IL Younger age and females were associated with lower inflammatory markers , and no significant effects of lifestyle factors ( alcohol , chat , smoking ) on immunological outcomes were observed . This vaccine elicited significant immunological responses in diabetic patients , characterized by initial increases in inflammatory markers and subsequent stabilization , and with implications for the healthcare policies to design tailored approaches for diabetic groups .
Immunologists generally view the notion of self and non self as part of a broader , more contextual understanding of immune function , rather than a rigid dogma . While the classical paradigm that the primary role of the immune system is to recognize and eliminate anything foreign once provided a unifying basis for explaining tolerance and rejection , numerous discoveries have focused attention on how immune responses are finely tuned by a range of contextual cues , including tissue signals , hygienist theory , molecular mimicry , symbiotic microbes , metabolic factors and epigenetic modifications . Maternal fetal tolerance and the persistence of microchimeric cells in adults demonstrate that genetically foreign cells can be actively integrated into the host , challenging the simple assumption that ' foreign ' equals unconditional attack . Similarly , research into the microbiome , the virome and the phenomenon of trained innate immunity has shown that there can be beneficial or even essential relationships between the body and what has traditionally been labelled ' non self ' . Over the last decade , the idea that the immune system strictly enforces a binary distinction has instead evolved towards a model in which it continuously interprets signals of damage or perturbation , manages complex ecological relationships with commensal or latent organisms , and recalibrates according to the organism ' s life stage and environment . There remains a recognition that clonal deletion and negative selection in the thymus , together with MHC bound peptide recognition , still underlie many core processes , and in certain clinical contexts , such as acute transplant rejection or the prevention of autoimmunity , an approximate self non self categorization is directly relevant . Overall , however , the field recognizes that ' self ' is not a static attribute defined once and for all , but rather a dynamic and context dependent state that continues to be shaped by microbial symbioses , epigenetic reprogramming and immunoregulatory networks throughout an individual ' s lifespan .
BACKGROUND : Mutations in the ARID1A gene , an integral component of the SWI/SNF complex , are prevalent , affecting prognosis and immune response in several malignancies , including gastric cancer ( GC ) . The aim of this study was to identify ARID1A mutation associated immune genes to construct an ARID1A related immune gene risk model ( ARM ) . METHODS : GSEA and ssGSEA were used to explore the involved biological pathways and the degree of immune cell infiltration , respectively . The prognosis model was constructed by lasso COX . Protein expression level in tissue was verified by immunohistochemistry . Small molecule compounds were screened using molecular docking techniques and their anticancer value was validated in vitro and in vivo experiment . RESULTS : This study revealed immune related pathways and infiltration level of multiple immune cell types were enriched in the ARID1A ( MUT ) group compared to the ARID1A ( WT ) group . ARID1A mutations were correlated with an improved prognosis in individuals treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor ( ICI ) analyzed via Cbioportal website . TCGA STAD cohort was randomly divided into a training group and a testing group . Additionally , ARM was developed in the training group , which identified APOD and PROC from ARID1A mutation associated differential immunity genes . A significantly poorer prognosis in the high risk group compared to the low risk group , which was consistent across TCGA training/testing/all cohorts , five GEO cohorts and 55 GC patients from Hainan General Hospital . Furthermore , the immune microenvironment components and ICI therapeutic efficacy markers were different between the two groups . Meanwhile , APOD and PROC expression was higher in GC tissues compared to para cancerous tissues . Baicalin and capsaicin inhibited the proliferation and metastatic ability of GC cells . CONCLUSION : ARM provides valuable insights into the prognosis and the effectiveness of ICI , thereby offering a novel strategy for clinical decision . Baicalin and capsaicin are promising potential drugs for GC treatment .
To clarify the microRNA ( miRNA ) target gene axis is involved in response to pathogen associated molecular pattern ( PAMP ) induced oxidative stress in shellfish , the full length cDNA of a novel mitogen activated protein kinase interacting kinase 1 ( MNK1 ) homolog gene from the scallop Patinopecten yessoensis ( PyMNK1 ) was cloned and characterized . The interaction between miR 1985 and PyMNK1 was verified , and then the responses and possible molecular function of miR 1985 , PyMNK1 , and miR 1985/PyMNK1 axis to poly ( I : C ) ( a classic virus related PAMP ) stimulation in P . yessoensis were explored and preliminarily dissected . The results indicate : 1 ) The full length cDNA of PyMNK1 was 5354 bp , with a high level of sequence conservation across mollusks . 2 ) MiR 1985 bound to the 3 ' UTR of PyMNK1 and negatively regulated the expression of PyMNK 3 ) PyMNK1 may repress the relative expression of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) by binding its promoter . 4 ) Both PyMNK1 silencing and miR 1985 overexpression promoted the expression and enzymatic activity of SOD . 5 ) The miR 1985/PyMNK1 axis may be involved in the response to poly ( I : C ) stimulation by elevating the activity of the SOD/catalase axis . To summarize , all observations from this study indicated that P . yessoensis may enhance its redox capability via the miR 1985/PyMNK1/SOD/CAT cascade and thereby alleviate PAMP induced oxidative stress .
Mucoinflammatory lung disease in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) is characterized by airway surface liquid ( ASL ) layer dehydration and mucins hyperconcentration , which leads to airway obstruction , inflammation , bronchiectasis , and increased susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is known to regulate airway mucous cell metaplasia ( MCM ) and mucins expression , but the role of EGFR pathway in the pathogenesis of CF like lung disease remains unclear . Therefore , we hypothesized that airway epithelial cell specific deficiency of EGFR mitigates mucoinflammatory responses in Scnn1b transgenic ( Tg+ ) mice that phenocopy human CF like lung disease . To test this hypothesis , we examined the effect of airway epithelial cell specific EGFR deficiency on the manifestation of mucoinflammatory outcomes in Tg+ mice . The airway epithelial cell specific EGFR deficient wild type ( WT ) mice did not exhibit any obvious structural and functional defects in the lungs . The deletion of EGFR in airway epithelial cells in Tg+ mice , however , resulted in increased recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages into the lung airspaces , which was accompanied by significantly increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) levels of inflammatory mediators , including KC , G CSF , MIP 2 , MIP 1alpha , TNF alpha , and MIP 1beta . Additionally , as compared with the EGFR sufficient Tg+ mice , the airway epithelial cell specific EGFR deficient Tg+ mice exhibited significantly increased postnatal mortality and compromised bacterial clearance . The deletion of EGFR in the airway epithelial cells of Tg+ mice resulted in an increased degree of mucus obstruction , which was associated with an increase in MCM and MUC5B production . Some of the molecular markers of type 2 inflammation , including Il13 , Slc26a4 , and Retnla , were significantly increased in airway epithelial cell specific EGFR deficient Tg+ mice versus EGFR sufficient Tg+ mice . Taken together , our data show that EGFR deletion in the airway epithelial cells compromises postnatal survival , delays bacterial clearance , and modulates inflammatory and mucus obstruction relevant endpoints , i . e . , MCM , MUC5B production , and mucus obstruction , in Tg+ mice .
Myeloid cells within tumor microenvironments exhibit significant heterogeneity and play a critical role in influencing clinical outcomes . In this study , we investigated the infiltration of various myeloid cell subtypes in a cohort of cutaneous melanomas , revealing no significant correlation between myeloid cell densities and the occurrence of distant metastasis . We further examined the phenotypic characteristics of primary melanoma tumor associated macrophages ( TAMs ) utilizing the seven phenotype classification recently proposed by Ma et al . , derived from extensive pan cancer single cell RNA sequencing studies . First , we analyzed the transcriptomic profile of TAMs isolated from stage IV metastasizing primary melanomas , alongside melanoma conditioned monocytes cultured in vitro , both supporting the inflammatory cytokine producing macrophage phenotype . Next , we employed multicolor fluorescence confocal microscopy , to assess the expression of TAM phenotype markers at the protein level in a cohort of primary melanoma samples . Notably , markers indicative of the inflammatory TAM phenotype , quantified at single cell level , were significantly enriched in metastasizing tumors , demonstrating an independent correlation with shorter disease free and overall survival ( log rank test , p< 0002 ) . Additionally , our screening of phenotype markers expression revealed that PD L1 positivity in tumor cells , rather than in TAMs , was associated with poor prognosis , highlighting a novel aspect of the immune landscape in cutaneous melanoma .
INTRODUCTION : Dementia is a neurodegenerative syndrome marked by the accumulation of disease specific proteins and immune dysregulation , including autoimmune mechanisms involving autoantibodies . Current diagnostic methods are often invasive , time consuming , or costly . METHODS : This study explores the use of proteome wide autoantibody screening ( PWAbS ) for noninvasive dementia diagnosis by analyzing serum samples from Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) , dementia with Lewy bodies ( DLB ) , and age matched cognitively normal individuals ( CNIs ) . Serum samples from 35 subjects were analyzed utilizing our original wet protein arrays displaying more than 13 , 000 human proteins . RESULTS : PWAbS revealed elevated gross autoantibody levels in AD and DLB patients compared to CNIs . A total of 229 autoantibodies were differentially elevated in AD and/or DLB , effectively distinguishing between patient groups . Machine learning models showed high accuracy in classifying AD , DLB , and CNIs . Gene ontology analysis highlighted autoantibodies targeting neuroactive ligands/receptors in AD and lipid metabolism proteins in DLB . Notably , autoantibodies targeting neuropeptide B ( NPB ) and adhesion G protein coupled receptor F5 ( ADGRF5 ) showed significant correlations with clinical traits including Mini Mental State Examination scores . DISCUSSION : The study demonstrates the potential of PWAbS and artificial intelligence integration as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for dementia , uncovering biomarkers that could enhance understanding of disease mechanisms . Limitations include demographic differences , small sample size , and lack of external validation . Future research should involve longitudinal observation in larger , diverse cohorts and functional studies to clarify autoantibodies ' roles in dementia pathogenesis and their diagnostic and therapeutic potential .
BACKGROUND : Psoriasis and Crohn ' s disease ( CD ) are chronic inflammatory diseases that involve complex immune mediated mechanisms . Despite clinical overlap and shared genetic predispositions , the molecular pathways connecting these diseases remain incompletely understood . The present study seeks to identify shared biomarkers and therapeutic targets for psoriasis and CD . METHODS : Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) were identified from publicly available transcriptomic datasets related to psoriasis and CD . Simultaneously , weighted gene co expression network analysis ( WGCNA ) was performed to identify gene modules associated with the clinical traits of psoriasis and CD . Subsequently , biomarkers were prioritized from shared key genes by integrating protein protein interaction ( PPI ) networks with machine learning models . Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) , along with Gene Ontology ( GO ) and KEGG pathway analyses , were performed to determine the biological significance of the identified genes . Immune infiltration analysis underscored the involvement of hub genes in immune regulation , while single cell transcriptomic analysis revealed the cellular localization of these hub genes . Additional targeted molecular biology experiments validated the shared biomarkers . DSigDB predictions were employed to identify potential therapeutic compounds . Molecular docking simulations were performed to assess the binding affinity of the drugs to key target proteins . Finally , additional in vitro experiments were conducted to validate the therapeutic effects of the identified compounds . RESULTS : The study identified KIF4A , DLGAP5 , NCAPG , CCNB1 , and CEP55 as key regulatory molecules and shared biomarkers for both diseases . GSEA and pathway analysis highlighted the importance of cell cycle regulation and immune response pathways in the comorbidities of psoriasis and CD . Immune infiltration analysis emphasized the role of hub genes in immune regulation . Furthermore , DSigDB predictions and molecular docking simulations indicated strong therapeutic potential for Etoposide , Lucanthone , and Piroxicam , with Etoposide showing the highest affinity for key targets . In cellular models , Etoposide demonstrated promising therapeutic effects by significantly downregulating the expression of psoriasis related keratinocytes marker genes ( KRT6 , KRT16 ) and CD related inflammatory cytokines ( IL6 , IL8 , TNF alpha ) , highlighting its potential in treating psoriasis and CD . DISCUSSION : This study integrates bioinformatics , machine learning , and molecular validation to identify the shared molecular mechanisms of psoriasis and CD , uncovering novel biomarkers and potential combined therapeutic candidates . These findings provide valuable insights into potential treatment strategies for these diseases .
Many immunotherapeutic approaches aim to induce epitope specific T cell cytotoxicity . However , the identification and especially the functional validation of suitable epitopes by in vitro cytotoxicity assays can be challenging , particularly when the number of available epitope specific cytotoxic T cells ( CTLs ) is limited . Here , we present a highly sensitive image based cytotoxicity assay that allows the functional analysis of rare epitope specific T cells . The live cell imaging based setup combines transient red labeling of target cells with a green caspase 3/7 probe , allowing reliable measurement of the fraction of apoptotic target cells . Time course analysis enables the monitoring of subtle differences . This highly flexible assay can be applied to assess the killing of either target cells with endogenous epitope presentation or those artificially loaded with the epitope of interest . Analysis of assay sensitivity demonstrated that cytotoxicity mediated by as few as 1% epitope specific CTLs in a T cell culture can still be detected . The epitope specificity of the assay was additionally validated by specific upregulation of PD 1 and LAG 3 on epitope specific T cells , as well as the epitope specific induction of interferon gamma release . Finally , the assay was successfully applied to functionally validate human papillomavirus ( HPV ) 16 epitopes , by detecting epitope specific killing of established patient derived tumor cell lines by rare T cell populations expanded from peripheral blood . Overall , this cytotoxicity assay setup provides a straightforward approach to assess the cytotoxic capacity of rare epitope specific T cells and enables the analysis of T cell responses against endogenously presented epitopes .
Shock , affecting a third of intensive care patients , remains a highly fatal condition despite advances in critical care , irrespective of its etiology . Cellular injury , central to shock pathophysiology , triggers the release of damage associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) , such as extracellular cold inducible RNA binding protein ( eCIRP ) , high mobility group box 1 ( HMGB1 ) , histones 3 and 4 , and adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . These molecules are confined within cells under normal conditions and perform essential physiological functions . However , upon their extracellular release during cellular injury , they act as alarmins , engaging pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) on immune cells . This interaction triggers a robust inflammatory response , propagating systemic inflammation and exacerbating tissue damage . Excessive DAMP mediated inflammation is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in a wide range of critical illnesses , including trauma , hemorrhagic shock , sepsis , and organ ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) injury . These pathologies are characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory cascades driven by the deleterious effects of DAMPs , underscoring the urgent need for targeted therapeutic interventions . This review explores the pivotal role of DAMPs in the pathogenesis of acute inflammation and shock , highlighting cutting edge therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating their effects . Emerging approaches include monoclonal antibodies , decoy receptors , small molecule inhibitors , and scavengers designed to neutralize or inhibit DAMP activity . The discussion also delves into the potential clinical applications of these interventions , offering insights into how targeting DAMPs could transform the management of shock and improve patient outcomes .
This review explores the critical interplay between glycemic control , mucosal immunity , and vaccine response in diabetic patients . Diabetes mellitus , characterized by impaired glucose regulation , significantly impacts immune function , particularly at mucosal surfaces . Poor glycemic control diminishes vaccine induced antibody responses and compromises mucosal defenses , such as secretory IgA production , increasing susceptibility to infections . We synthesize evidence highlighting the importance of optimizing glycemic management prior to vaccination to enhance immunogenicity . Furthermore , we examine the potential of personalized vaccination strategies , tailored to individual glycemic status , age , BMI , and kidney function , to improve vaccine efficacy in this vulnerable population . Additionally , we discuss the role of adjunct therapies , including probiotics , nutritional interventions , and lifestyle modifications , in modulating the gut microbiota and reinforcing mucosal barrier integrity . This review underscores the necessity for an interdisciplinary approach , integrating metabolic management with innovative vaccine designs , to maximize protection against infectious diseases in diabetic patients . Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies assessing both systemic and mucosal immunity and refine personalized vaccination strategies to ensure robust and durable protection .
BACKGROUND : Toll like receptor 3 ( TLR3 ) is a pattern recognition receptor known to play a crucial role in the immune response to cancer . However , its effect on the efficacy of immunotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma ( LUAD ) remains unclear . This study aims to investigate the role of TLR3 in LUAD by examining its expression levels , prognostic significance , and impact on immune signaling pathways . METHODS : We analyzed the impact of TLR3 expression on the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) database and four additional cohorts ( GSE72094 , GSE30219 , GSE50081 and GSE31210 ) . Functional enrichment analyses were performed to compare molecular features between low and high TLR3 expression groups using gene set variation analysis ( GSVA ) . We also examined the correlation between TLR3 and tumor mutation burden ( TMB ) , immune infiltration , and PD L1 expression . Further experimental validation was conducted using co culture systems of LUAD cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) with PD1 inhibitors , and Western blot analysis to investigate the involvement of NF kappaB signaling . RESULTS : TLR3 expression was significantly lower in LUAD tissues compared to normal tissues , with high TLR3 expression correlating with better survival outcomes across multiple cohorts . High TLR3 expression was associated with increased TMB and enhanced immune activation . Patients with high TLR3 expression exhibited higher immune checkpoint expression and immune cell infiltration . Experimental results showed that TLR3 agonists increased the susceptibility of LUAD cells to activated PBMCs under PD1 inhibitor therapy , inhibiting cell proliferation , migration , and invasion . Additionally , TLR3 has a strong positive correlation with MHC molecules and upregulated PD L1 expression . NF kappaB was identified as a key regulator of PD L1 expression , with TLR3 agonists enhancing NF kappaB and PD L1 activity . CONCLUSION : TLR3 enhances the anti tumor immune response in LUAD by modulating NF kappaB signaling and PD L1 expression , making it a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target . This study highlights the potential of TLR3 to improve immunotherapy outcomes , providing a comprehensive analysis of its role in LUAD and paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting TLR3 mediated pathways .
Recent studies have identified that RNA epigenetic modifications , including m6A , m1A , m5C , etc , play pivotal roles in tumor progression . These modifications influence mRNA stability , RNA processing , translational efficiency , and decoding precision . However , comprehensive reviews detailing the connection between m6A RNA modifications and hormone dependent cancers in both male and female populations remain scarce ( breast cancer , ovarian cancer , and endometrial cancer , prostate cancer ) . In this article , we explore the cellular and molecular roles of various RNA modifications alongside the key elements of the tumor microenvironment . We examine how these RNA modifications influence the development of hormone dependent cancers through their impact on immune mechanisms . By enhancing our understanding of the function of RNA modifications within the immune systems of four specific tumors , we offer fresh insights for their potential applications in diagnosis and treatment .
BACKGROUND : Although immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) represent a substantial breakthrough in cancer treatment , it is crucial to acknowledge that their efficacy is limited to a subset of patients . The heterogeneity and stemness of cancer render its response to immunotherapy variable , warranting the identification of robust biomarkers for evaluation . METHODS : Publicly available Ovarian Cancer ( OV ) single cell RNA ( scRNA ) sequence dataset was collected and analyzed to elucidate the intrinsic driver gene of OV cancer cells . Through genome scale CRISPR screening of RNA sequencing data from Project Achilles , essential genes specific to OV were identified . A novel cancer stem cell index ( CSCI ) was developed and validated using multiple advanced algorithms and large scale datasets , as well as corresponding clinical features , including 14 OV transcriptomic datasets , 7 pan cancer ICI transcriptomic cohorts and one melanoma scRNA dataset derived from PD 1 treated patients . RESULTS : Chromosomal 20q gain , 8q gain , and 5q loss have been identified as ovarian cancer specific driving variations . By analyzing large scale datasets of ovarian cancer transcriptomics , including scRNA and CRISPR cell line datasets , we have identified a gene set that influences tumor intrinsic drivers and stemness properties . We then developed the CSCI to predict the prognosis and response to immunotherapy in ovarian cancer patients using advanced machine learning algorithms . When applied to PD1/PD L1 ICI transcriptomic cohorts , CSCI consistently and accurately predicts tumor progression and immunotherapy benefits , with a mean AUC greater than Notably , compared to previously established signatures , CSCI demonstrates better predictive performance across multiple ovarian cancer datasets . Intriguingly , we discovered that amplification of CSE1L enhances the stemness of tumor initiating cells , facilitates angiogenesis , and the formation of ovarian cancer , which can serve as a potential therapeutic target . Finally , experiments validated that CSE1L promotes progression , migration , and proliferation of ovarian cancer . CONCLUSIONS : Our study has uncovered a robust correlation between variations in cancer intrinsic drivers and stemness , as well as resistance to immunotherapy . This finding provides valuable insights for potential strategies to overcome immune resistance by targeting genes associated with stemness .
Astrocytes play a pivotal role in the inflammatory response triggered by traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . They are not only involved in the initial inflammatory response following injury but also significantly contribute to Astrocyte activation and inflammasome release are key processes in the pathophysiology of TBI , significantly affecting the progression of secondary injury and long term outcomes . This comprehensive review explores the complex triggering mechanisms of astrocyte activation following TBI , the intricate pathways controlling the release of inflammasomes from activated astrocytes , and the subsequent neuroinflammatory cascade and its multifaceted roles after injury . The exploration of these processes not only deepens our understanding of the neuroinflammatory cascade but also highlights the potential of astrocytes as critical therapeutic targets for TBI interventions . We then evaluate cutting edge research aimed at targeted therapeutic approaches to modulate pro inflammatory astrocytes and discuss emerging pharmacological interventions and their efficacy in preclinical models . Given that there has yet to be a relevant review elucidating the specific intracellular mechanisms targeting astrocyte release of inflammatory substances , this review aims to provide a nuanced understanding of astrocyte mediated neuroinflammation in TBI and elucidate promising avenues for therapeutic interventions that could fundamentally change TBI management and improve patient outcomes . The development of secondary brain injury and long term neurological sequelae . By releasing a variety of cytokines and chemokines , astrocytes regulate neuroinflammation , thereby influencing the survival and function of surrounding cells . In recent years , researchers have concentrated their efforts on elucidating the signaling crosstalk between astrocytes and other cells under various conditions , while exploring potential therapeutic interventions targeting these cells . This paper highlights the specific mechanisms by which astrocytes produce inflammatory mediators during the acute phase post TBI , including their roles in inflammatory signaling , blood brain barrier integrity , and neuronal protection . Additionally , we discuss current preclinical and clinical intervention strategies targeting astrocytes and their potential to mitigate neurological damage and enhance recovery following TBI . Finally , we explore the feasibility of pharmacologically assessing astrocyte activity post TBI as a biomarker for predicting acute phase neuroinflammatory changes .
BACKGROUND : Metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis ( MASH ) is becoming increasingly prevalent . Regulated cell death ( RCD ) has emerged as a significant disease phenotype and may act as a marker for liver fibrosis . The present study aimed to investigate the regulation of RCD related genes in MASH to elucidate the role of RCD in the progression of MASH . METHODS : The gene expression profiles from the GSE130970 and GSE49541 datasets were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) database for analysis . A total of 101 combinations of 10 machine learning algorithms were employed to screen for characteristic RCD related differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) that reflect the progression of MASH . Gene Ontology ( GO ) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) analyses were conducted to explore the enrichment pathways and functions of the feature genes . we performed cell classification analysis to investigate immune cell infiltration . Consensus cluster analysis was performed to identify MASH subtypes associated with RCD . The GSE89632 dataset was utilized to analyze the correlation of characteristic genes with clinical features of MASH . The DGIdb database was employed to screen for potential therapeutic drugs and compounds targeting the feature genes . In addition , we established mouse liver fibrosis models induced by methionine choline deficient ( MCD ) diet or CCl4 treatment , and further validated the expression of characteristic genes through quantitative real time PCR ( q PCR ) . Lastly , we knocked down EPHA3 in LX2 cells to explore its effect on TGFb induced activation of LX2 cells . RESULTS : This study discovered a total of 11 RCD associated DEGs , which predicted the progression of MASH . Advanced MASH has higher levels of immune cell infiltration and is significantly correlated with the RCD related DEGs expression . MASH can be classified into two subtypes , cluster 1 and cluster 2 , based on these feature genes . Compared with cluster 1 , cluster 2 has highly expressed RCD related DEGs , shows an increase in the degree of fibrosis . Furthermore , We discovered that the expression levels of feature genes were positively correlated with AST and ALT levels . Subsequently , We also evaluated the expression of these 11 feature genes in the liver tissues of mice with fibrosis induced by MCD or CCl4 , and the results suggested that these genes may be involved in the development of fibrosis . WB results showed that the protein level of EPHA3 significantly increased in both mouse models of liver fibrosis . In vitro , we observed that knocking down EPHA3 in LX2 cells significantly inhibited the activation of the TGF beta/Smad3 signaling pathway . CONCLUSION : Our study sheds light on the fact that RCD contribute to the progression of MASH , high lighting potential therapeutic targets for treating this disease .

Our model could guide personalized treatment strategies and improve bladder cancer patient outcomes .
INTRODUCTION : HIV proteins , such as the Transactivator of transcription ( Tat ) , mediate neuroinflammation in the central nervous system by promoting the release of pro inflammatory cytokines and chemokines . Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) regulate gene expression by sponging microRNAs ( miRs ) , but their role in HIV Tat mediated microglial activation remains poorly understood . This study aimed to investigate the involvement of the lncRNA Xist miR 124 CCL2 axis in HIV Tat exposed microglial cells . METHODS : Mouse primary microglial cells were exposed to HIV Tat , and the expression of lncRNA Xist , miR 124 , and CCL2 was evaluated using qPCR , Western blotting , and ELISA . Dual luciferase reporter and Argonaute immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm molecular interactions . Functional experiments involved lncRNA Xist silencing and miR 124 overexpression . In vivo validation was performed using doxycycline inducible HIV Tat transgenic mice . RESULTS : HIV Tat significantly upregulated lncRNA Xist and downregulated miR 124 expression in mouse primary microglial cells . miR 124 was identified as a direct target of lncRNA Xist and the 3 ' UTR of CCL Silencing lncRNA Xist or overexpressing miR 124 reduced HIV Tat induced CCL2 expression and microglial activation . In vivo studies corroborated these findings , with doxycycline fed iTat mice showing elevated lncRNA Xist and CCL2 levels and reduced miR 124 expression in the frontal cortex . DISCUSSION : Our findings identify a novel regulatory axis whereby HIV Tat induced upregulation of lncRNA Xist sponges miR 124 , leading to CCL2 overexpression and microglial activation . Targeting the lncRNA Xist miR 124 CCL2 pathway may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate neuroinflammation associated with NeuroHIV .
BACKGROUND : To further explore the disease heterogeneity of different subtypes of Juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) and analyze their pathogenesis mechanisms . METHOD : The single cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA seq ) analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) was carried out to investigate the disease heterogeneity and molecular mechanisms of immune responses in immune cells in JIA . RESULT : In our study , we provided a immunological landscape of HLA B27 positive JIA and HLA B27 negative JIA immune cells at single cell RNA Seq resolution . We found a higher proportion of CCR7+/RELB+/IRF1+ triple positive T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with JIA , and such T cells were predominantly present in HLA B27 ( + ) JIA patients . Furthermore , we hypothesized that CCR7+/RELB+/IRF1+ triple positive T cells were highly activated T cells capable of promoting the differentiation of osteoclasts by producing IL 17 , thus causing damage to cartilage in HLA B27 ( + ) JIA patients . Unlike JIA patients , CCR7+/RELB+/IRF1+ triple positive T cells were not found in the peripheral blood of pSS patients and SLE patients , moreover , T cells from pSS patients and SLE patients were less able to produce IL 17 than those from JIA patients . CONCLUSION : Our study provided evidence of cellular and molecular levels of involvement in JIA pathogenesis and identified the critical roles for T cells in JIA pathogenesis . Furthermore , our results suggested that there were significant differences in T cell composition and gene expression between HLA B27 ( + ) JIA patients and HLA B27 ( ) JIA patients . Our findings indicated that CCR7+/RELB+/IRF1+ positive T cells could damage the cartilage of HLA B27 ( + ) JIA by producing cytokines such as IL
OBJECTIVE : As a distinctive subset of T cells , intraepithelial lymphocytes ( IELs ) are found in the epithelium of mucosal barrier and serve as the primary defenders of the intestinal mucosal immune system . IELs exhibit phenotypic and functional diversity with high expression of activated marker molecules , tissue homing integrins , NK cell receptors , cytotoxic T cell related molecules , and cytokines . Meanwhile , IELs demonstrate differentiation plasticity , antigen recognition diversity , self reactivity , and rapid " memory " effect , which enable them to play a crucial role in regulating responses , maintaining mucosal barriers , promoting immune tolerance , and providing resistance to infections . In addition , IELs have been explored in autoimmune diseases , inflammatory diseases , and cancers . However , the specific involvement and underlying mechanisms of IELs in oral diseases have not been systematically discussed . METHODS : A systematic literature review was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE databases to identify and analyze relevant literatures on the roles of IELs in oral diseases . RESULTS : The literature review revealed the characteristics of IELs and emphasized the potential roles of IELs in the pathogenesis of oral lichen planus , oral cancers , periodontal diseases , graft versus host disease , and primary Sjogren ' s syndrome . CONCLUSION : This review mainly focuses on the involvement of IELs in oral diseases , with a particular emphasis on the main functions and underlying mechanisms by which IELs influence the pathogenesis and progression of these conditions .
BACKGROUND : The COVID 19 pandemic demanded diverse vaccination strategies , and there is significant interest in their effectiveness in generating a robust immune response . In Brazil , the use of CoronaVac was crucial in reducing mortality ; however , heterologous booster doses were necessary to enhance memory immune response . This study aimed to evaluate the humoral and cellular immunity in healthcare workers who were vaccinated with a complete regimen of CoronaVac and subsequently received heterologous booster doses over nearly one year . METHODS : A longitudinal study recruited healthcare professionals with varying levels of exposure to SARS CoV 2 from the Health Complex of the Rio de Janeiro State University ( UERJ ) , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . Blood samples were collected at five time points , including baseline and after vaccination with CoronaVac and heterologous booster doses ( ChAdOx1 nCov 19 or BNT162b2 ) . The Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine production was measured by Flow Cytometry , using whole blood samples stimulated or not with the SARS CoV 2 Spike protein . In parallel , serum levels of IgG antibodies against Spike ( anti S ) and Nucleocapsid ( anti N ) proteins were assessed using an immunoassay . Adjustments were made for confounding factors , including age , sex , level of SARS CoV 2 exposure , and COVID 19 infection status . RESULTS : Our results demonstrate that CoronaVac induced high anti S IgG levels at all evaluated time points ( P<01 ) . Cytokine analysis revealed a sustained production of antigen specific Th1 cytokines , including IL 2 ( P<01 ) and IFN gamma ( P<05 ) regardless of level of SARS CoV 2 exposure or previous COVID 19 infection at any point during the study . Additionally , we identified six moderate to strong positive correlations ( P<0001 ) : IL 10 and IFN gamma ( rho=77 ) , IL 6 and TNF ( rho=77 ) , IL 2 and IFN gamma ( rho=71 ) , IL 6 and IL 10 ( rho=66 ) , anti N IgG and anti S IgG ( rho=62 ) , and IL 2 and anti S IgG ( rho=62 ) . CONCLUSION : The CoronaVac elicited an antigen specific cellular immune response , characterized by enhancing the production of key cytokines such as IFN gamma and IL 2 , with high levels of anti S IgG . Furthermore , the administration of heterologous boosters significantly enhanced these immune responses , demonstrating induced specific immunological response . These findings underscore the importance of primary vaccination and boosters in inducing immune protection against COVID 19 , potentially informing future vaccination policies and approaches .
CD19 directed CAR T cell therapy is a breakthrough immunotherapy for B cell malignancies . However , CD19 loss mediated relapsed/refractory disease continues to pose a significant challenge , highlighting the urgent need for CAR T cells targeting alternative antigens . To address this issue , we developed a CD20 directed CAR T incorporated with an additional CD30 directed binder to enhance cytotoxicity toward cancer cells . Here , we report that a patient with bulky transformed follicular lymphoma was successfully treated with CD20/CD30 directed CAR T cells . The patient received two doses of anti CD20/CD30 CAR T therapy administered one month apart . Complete metabolic remission was achieved 1 month after the first infusion without evidence of cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) or immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome ( ICANS ) . The second dose was given as a consolidation therapy with sustained disease free survival exceeding 12 months to date . The report underscores the promising therapeutic potential and safety profile of CD20/CD30 directed CAR T cell therapy .

Among various pathogens , viruses pose significant threats to the livestock and poultry industry , resulting in substantial annual costs due to production losses and vaccination . The MHC I presentation pathway is a crucial surveillance mechanism for preventing viral infections . Consequently , many viruses have evolved sophisticated strategies to inhibit the presentation of viral peptides by MHC I to CD8 ( + ) T cells , thereby evading the immune system . Understanding the mechanisms that suppress the MHC I pathway and identifying specific binding peptides are essential for comprehending viral immune evasion and developing effective animal vaccines . This review summarizes the viral strategies for evading immune recognition , including the inhibition of MHC I molecules synthesis , degradation , transport , and assembly , which affect MHC I surface expression during viral infections . We also present evidence that MHC I surface expression is frequently lost during numerous viral infections in livestock and poultry and offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms through which viruses inactivate the MHC I antigen presentation pathway . Collectively , these advanced findings on viral evasion from the MHC I pathway could inform the development of more effectives strategies to restore immunological control over viral infections and improve vaccines for the livestock and poultry industry .
Early antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) is essential for controlling HIV 1 replication and boosting immune function . gammadelta T cells , as a vital component of the innate immune system , are implicated in the antiviral response . However , their immunological profile during acute HIV 1 infection and the early stages of ART remains unclear . This study aimed to delineate the immunological landscape of gammadelta T cells in individuals with acute HIV 1 infection undergoing early ART . We enrolled 65 participants who initiated ART immediately post diagnosis and assessed the phenotypes and functions of gammadelta T cells using flow cytometry . We demonstrated that early ART significantly increased the frequency of Vdelta2 T cells , while the Vdelta1 T cell frequency remained stable and showed an inverse relationship with CD4 ( + ) T cell counts after ART . Early ART normalized the activation and PD 1 expression in Vdelta1 and Vdelta2 T cells , aligning with healthy controls ( HCs ) levels . Nevertheless , the proliferation of these cells , particularly within the PD 1 ( + ) subset , remains elevated post ART . We also noted a reduction in perforin secretion in PD 1 ( + ) Vdelta1 and Vdelta2 T cells of people living with HIV ( PLWH ) . Furthermore , Vdelta1 T cells were identified as the predominant regulatory T cells , with TGF beta production and co expression of CD127 and CXCR4 , negatively correlated with CD8 ( + ) T cell activation . Our study elucidates the dynamic immunological characteristics of gammadelta T cells in acute HIV 1 infection and early ART , contributing to the understanding of their role in HIV 1 pathogenesis and the potential for gammadelta T cell based immunotherapeutic strategies .
Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a classic autoimmune disease caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors . The multiple and comprehensive pathologies involving the whole body ' s immune system and local organs and tissues make it challenging to control or cure them clinically . Fortunately , there are increasing reports that multiple non toxic or low toxicity natural products and their derivatives ( NP&TDs ) have positive therapeutic effects on RA . This review focuses on the potential mechanisms of NP&TDs against RA and aims to provide constructive information for developing rational clinical therapies . Active components of NP&TDs can play therapeutic and palliative roles in RA through multiple biological mechanisms . These mechanisms primarily involve immunosuppressive , anti inflammatory , autophagic , and apoptotic pathways . Multiple targets and receptor coupled signal transduction can directly or indirectly modulates the nuclear transcription factors NF kappaB , NFATc1 , STAT3 , and HIF 1alpha , which in turn regulate the production of several downstream pro inflammatory cytokines , chemokines , immunocytes maturation and differentiation , immune complexes , proliferation , and apoptosis regulatory genes . Among these NP&TDs , the tripterygium type ingredients , the artemisinin type ingredients , and the paeony type ingredients have been reported to be the mainstay in treating RA . Mechanistically , immunosuppression and anti inflammation are still the primary therapeutic mechanisms . Nevertheless , the direct binding targets and pharmacodynamic mechanisms require further in depth studies .
Sex differences in immune system development and response to pathogens has been well documented , with females exhibiting more favorable outcomes for certain infections but a higher incidence of autoimmune disease compared to males . At least some of these sex differences are mediated by sex hormones , which signal through sex hormone receptors to remodel the regulatory chromatin landscape of cells . Here , we summarize the current knowledge of how sex hormone receptors remodel chromatin structure and epigenetic marks in different contexts in humans . As the epigenome is fundamental to specifying cell identity and function , and reflects past exposures , epigenetic variation can influence cellular responses to future stimuli . This has implications for susceptibility to infection and complex inflammatory disease in a range of hormone therapy settings , including gender affirming hormone therapy in transgender people . Therefore , profiling of epigenetic marks in the context of gender affirming hormone therapy is an important unexplored field of research .
Lung cancer continues to be the primary cause of cancer related deaths globally , with non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) accounting for approximately 85% of all instances . Recently , immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) have transformed the treatment approach for NSCLC , however , only a subset of patients experiences significant benefits . Therefore , identifying reliable biomarkers to forecast the efficacy of ICIs is crucial for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of treatments , becoming a major focus of current research efforts . This review highlights the recent advances in predictive biomarkers for the efficacy of ICIs in the treatment of NSCLC , including PD L1 expression , tertiary lymphoid structures ( TLS ) , tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) , tumor genomic alterations , transcriptional signatures , circulating biomarkers , and the microbiome . Furthermore , it underscores the pivotal roles of liquid biopsy , sequencing technologies , and digital pathology in biomarker discovery . Special attention is given to the predictive value of TLS , circulating biomarkers , and transcriptional signatures . The review concludes that the integration of multiple biomarkers holds promise for achieving more accurate efficacy predictions and optimizing personalized immunotherapy strategies . By providing a comprehensive overview of the current progress , this review offers valuable insights into biomarker based precision medicine for NSCLC and outlines future research directions .
INTRODUCTION : The H9N2 avian influenza virus , although not highly pathogenic , still poses ongoing risks to poultry health and food security due to its ability to resist vaccines and its potential to spread to humans . METHODS : This study investigated the effects of baicalin , a flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis , on respiratory mucosal immunity during H9N2 infection . In vitro experiments were conducted using MLE 12 alveolar epithelial cells , and in vivo evaluations were performed in a mouse model of H9N2 infection . RESULTS : Baicalin treatment enhanced the expression of antiviral proteins Mx1 and PKR in a dose and time dependent manner , helping to counteract the virus ' s suppression of these defense proteins . In addition to strengthening this epithelial barrier , baicalin has both antiviral and immune regulating effects : it directly blocks viral replication and helps restore the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in H9N2 infected mice . Most importantly , baicalin reduces lung damage and spleen shrinkage while keeping the immune system balanced . These results show that baicalin enhances mucosal antiviral defenses by simultaneously regulating innate antiviral pathways ( Mx1 and PKR ) and restoring adaptive immune balance ( CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio ) . DISCUSSION : These dual protective effects highlight baicalin ' s potential as a natural therapeutic strategy for improving mucosal immunity against vaccine resistant influenza viruses such as H9N2 , contributing valuable insights into plant derived immunomodulatory approaches against emerging zoonotic viral threats .
OBJECTIVE : to assess the prognostic impact of clusters of hematologic and biochemical indices on interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) and respiratory damage associated with systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) . METHODS : Design : We conducted a cross sectional , uncontrolled study . Participants and Settings : a cohort of patients with SSc ( 2013 ACR/EULAR criteria ) were enrolled in the rheumatology unit of a tertiary hospital in southern Spain . Primary and secondary outcome measures : The primary outcomes were the presence of SSc ILD and respiratory damage , assessed via the Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium Damage Index ( SCTC DI ) . Inflammatory biomarkers , including both CRP and hematological indices , were obtained . Patients were grouped based on inflammatory phenotypes derived from longitudinal CRP averages and through principal component analysis ( PCA ) with K means clustering of cross sectional variables . Multivariate models were constructed to identify factors associated with SSc ILD and respiratory damage . RESULTS : Among 83 patients with SSc , 7% had ILD , 1% had respiratory damage , and 9% were receiving immunosuppressive therapy . A persistent inflammatory phenotype during follow up was associated with non Caucasian ethnicity ( OR 0 ) and SSc ILD ( OR 9 ) . Cross sectional inflammatory clusters were linked to SSc ILD ( OR 8 ) and damage measured by SCTC DI ( OR 2 ) . PC 2 , derived from CRP based variables , was a better predictor of SSc ILD ( OR 0 ) than PC 1 , which was based on hematological indices ( OR 5 , non significant ) , especially in the presence of anti Scl70+ antibodies ( OR 1 ) and immunosuppressants ( OR 2 ) . The only variables associated with respiratory damage were average CRP during follow up ( OR 2 ) , anti Scl70+ ( OR 7 ) , and glucocorticoids ( OR 2 ) . CONCLUSION : CRP based variables seem to be better predictors of SSc ILD and respiratory damage than hematological indices .
This review explores recent advances in the characteristics and manufacturing of CAR T cell products . Traditional potency assays have been designed based on well established CAR T cell functionalities . However , the advent of innovative tools and methodologies has revealed a broader spectrum of important CAR T cell characteristics that correlate with function . Furthermore , as manufacturing strategies continue to evolve , conventional potency assays may no longer fully capture the complexity of these products . Therefore , it is essential to examine these emerging characteristics and manufacturing approaches and consider the development of tailored potency assays to ensure products are fully characterized .
Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) gene variations are involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport , with the ApoE4 allele being a known risk factor associated with neurodegenerative conditions later in life . Emerging evidence suggests these genetic variations may also influence respiratory function and vitality . However , the specific impact of different ApoE genotypes on breathing patterns remains largely unexplored . This work investigates differences in breathing waveform characteristics and entropy statistics derived from plethysmography ( PLETH ) data between rat models possessing two distinct ApoE genotypes ( referred to herein as gene59 and gene95 ) . Findings reveal significant distributional differences in common plethysmography metrics and approximate entropy between the two genotypes , observed during both active and resting states . Additionally , the study examines the transient impact of sighs ( deep breaths ) on these breathing metrics , demonstrating that entropy and other measures are altered in the breaths immediately following a sigh .

BACKGROUND : The Dog Aging Project ( DAP ) is a large scale longitudinal study for studying aging in dogs . For some dogs in the DAP , blood samples for plasma isolation are collected by non DAP personnel . However , plasma samples are sometimes inadequate , eg , insufficient volume for assays . OBJECTIVE : We aimed to examine three factors that may affect plasma yield : resting time after sample collection , centrifugation time , and level of operator or technician training . METHODS : We designed three experiments using a convenience sample of 5 dogs . Each experiment varied one of the three factors and held the other two constant . Experiment 1 examined 5 different resting times : 10 minutes and 1 , 4 , 24 , and 72 hours . Experiment 2 compared centrifugation times of 7 and 14 minutes . Experiment 3 compared trained and untrained personnel . Sample resting was always under refrigeration . Experimental outcomes were total plasma volume , number of successful aliquots , hemolysis , and lipemia . RESULTS : A resting time of 72 hours yielded statistically significantly lower plasma volume than resting times </= 4 hours . Resting times of 24 and 72 hours also had statistically significantly higher hemolysis scores compared with other resting time points . In addition , trained operators or technicians yielded an average of 5 more aliquots . Outcomes were similar by centrifugation time in Experiment CONCLUSION : To mitigate sample loss , we recommend shorter post collection resting times and ensuring technician proficiency . Additionally , increasing the requested whole blood volume may improve sample yield . FAU Holland , Sydney N

OUTCOME MEASURES AND COMPARISONS : Primary outcome measures included characterization of patient risk factors for increased intensive care unit LOS , hospital LOS , and in hospital complications . Secondary outcome measures included characterization of patients who were stratified as " at risk " for malnutrition by PAB < 20 mg/dL and identification of complication predictors . RESULTS : Fifty one ( 32% ) patients were stratified as " at risk " for malnutrition based on serum PAB < 20 mg/dL drawn within 24 hours of arrival . These patients had longer median hospital LOS ( P < 001 ) , were more likely to stay in the hospital longer than 7 days ( P < 009 ) and >14 days ( OR = 20 , 95% CI 17 07 , P < 001 ) , and had twice the amount of postoperative complications during their hospital stay ( P = 04 ) than patients with PAB >/= 20 mg/dL . CONCLUSIONS : Patients with orthopaedic trauma can reliably and cost effectively be screened and stratified for risk of malnutrition using PAB drawn with immediate admission labs . LEVEL OF EVIDENCE : Level III .
Greenhouse gases produced by livestock are important contributors to climate change . The ability to measure large scale exhaled metabolic gases from cattle using GreenFeed systems will help farmers to reduce enteric emissions while maintaining or increasing cow productivity . GreenFeed units are portable chamber systems that measure individual animal gas production in real time . Thus , the machines generate large amounts of daily data that can be overwhelming for users to process . This challenge motivated us to develop an R package named greenfeedr that offers functions for downloading , processing , and reporting GreenFeed data . Herein , we describe all functions implemented in the greenfeedr R package and present examples based on dairy cow data . The R package has functions for downloading GreenFeed data ( get_gfdata ) , for generating daily and final reports ( report_gfdata ) , for processing daily and final records ( process_gfdata ) , and extra functions that help to extract information regarding pellet intakes and daily visits ( pellin and viseat ) . Using our example data with 32 lactating dairy cows , we demonstrated the capabilities of the different functions to generate easy to read reports and process large amount of data . Also , we included in the function process_gfdata some parameters that will help users to define the best criteria to process their own GreenFeed data . Overall , greenfeedr represents an important advancement in the management and analysis of GreenFeed data , offering an efficient tool tailored to the needs of the user .
This study aimed to quantify the association between fecal microbiota biomarkers , gastrointestinal tract morphology , and ADG of dairy calves from birth until weaning in response to feeding a direct fed microbial ( DFM ) supplement as part of their milk diet . We randomly assigned 44 newborn Holstein Friesian calves to treatment ( TRT ) and control ( CON ) groups . The TRT group calves received a once daily dose of Lacticaseibacillus and Lentilactobacillus based DFM liquid formulation . Four genera , Prevotella7 , Succiniclasticum , Terrisporobacter , and Carnobacterium , were enriched and identified as biomarkers of low ADG . A total of 14 bacterial taxa were associated with measured gastrointestinal histopathology variables in TRT and CON groups . Although this study lists several bacterial taxa that have known roles in fermentation and nutrient metabolism vital for rumen function , their specific contributions to gastrointestinal development and weight gain remain to be fully understood . Our findings support a strategic approach to probiotic use in heifers to boost health and productivity .
Differences in feed efficiency among dairy cows could be partially explained by changes in body temperature due to the heat increment . This heat represents chemical energy lost , and theoretically , it should be lower in more efficient cows . The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between 3 body temperature traits , namely average body temperature , consistency of body temperature , and change in body temperature after the largest meal of the day , with 4 feed efficiency traits : DMI , milk energy , metabolic BW , and residual feed intake ( RFI ) in lactating Holstein cows . Data were collected from 1 , 068 mid lactation Holstein cows enrolled in 36 feed efficiency trials from 2020 to 2023 at 5 research stations across the United States . Temperature records were obtained using an automatic temperature logger placed vaginally for 2 wk . Average body temperature was calculated as the individual mean , daily and over the 2 wk period , and consistency of body temperature was calculated as the log transformed variance of the deviations of individual records from the cow ' s mean . Change in body temperature was calculated for a subset of cows that used the roughage intake control system ( n = 278 ) and was defined as the difference in temperature after and before the largest meal of the day . Data for DMI , milk energy , metabolic BW , and RFI were collected from the same cows for 6 to 7 wk during the feeding trials . The associations between body temperature traits and feed efficiency traits were assessed using univariate linear regression models including cohort ( trial treatment ) , temperature humidity index ( THI ) , and the interaction between THI and research station as independent variables . Partial correlations between body temperature and feed efficiency traits controlling for cohort were calculated . Additionally , the importance of body temperature traits on RFI calculation was also evaluated . Increased body temperature was associated with cow that ate less and were lighter . Consistency of body temperature was negatively associated with DMI and milk energy , showing that greater variance in body temperature is linked to higher DMI and more milk energy . Smaller changes in body temperature after the largest meal were associated with lower DMI and milk energy . Adding body temperature traits to the RFI model did not change the coefficient of determination ( adjusted R ) , which remained approximately We found that cows that eat less have higher body temperatures , with less fluctuation throughout the day , compared with cows that consume more feed and produce more milk . Overall , our results suggest that vaginal temperature did not capture the heat increment expected in high RFI cows .
This study evaluated the effect of feeding milk replacers ( MR ) differing in fat composition on plasma cholesterol of dairy calves . Forty five individually housed male Holstein calves ( 3 +/ 82 d ; mean +/ SD ) were blocked by arrival day and age . Within each block , calves were randomly assigned to an MR containing a fat blend with 65% rapeseed and 35% coconut fats ( RC ) , an MR containing 65% palm and 35% coconut fats ( PC ) , and an MR containing 65% lard and 35% dairy cream ( LD ) . All MR were isoenergetic with 30% fat , 25% protein , and 36% lactose ( DM ) . Calves were fed 0 L/d from d 1 to 5 , 0 L/d from d 6 to 9 , and 0 L/d from d 10 to 35 at 5% solids . Water and chopped wheat straw were available ad libitum from arrival onward . Milk , water , and straw intakes were recorded daily . Blood was sampled and BW was measured weekly at 1300 h . Fecal scores were recorded daily after the morning meal . Growth and intakes did not differ among treatments . Plasma total cholesterol , high density lipoprotein cholesterol , and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were higher in calves fed RC than PC and LD , and higher in calves fed PC than LD . Additionally , plasma triglyceride was greater in calves fed PC than LD at wk 2 after arrival , while calves fed RC did not differ from other groups . The proportion of abnormal fecal scores was lower in calves fed RC than PC and LD in wk The fat composition in MR significantly influenced lipid metabolism in calves but had no impact on growth .
BACKGROUND : Arthritis is a common degenerative joint disease with a high prevalence especially in the elderly population . Due to its strong association with chronic pain and dysfunction , arthritis has become an important challenge in public health . Recent studies have shown that triglyceride ( TG ) levels , as key metabolic markers , may play an important role in the pathogenesis of arthritis , and its associated inflammatory response may accelerate joint degeneration and inflammatory process . OBJECTIVE : Based on the above findings , the aim of this study was to investigate the association between baseline TG levels and the incidence of arthritis in adults aged 45 years and older , utilizing data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study ( CHARLS ) . METHODS : This study utilized the CHARLS from 2011 to 2018 , which included 7 , 551 participants aged 45 years and older . The association between TG levels and new onset arthritis was assessed by logistic regression modeling , adjusting for demographic and health related variables . The potential role of HDL C , LDL C , and BMI in the TG arthritis association was further assessed by mediation analysis , which decomposed the association into direct and indirect effects . RESULTS : During the study period , 3 , 363 participants ( 5% ) developed arthritis . Higher TG levels were significantly associated with arthritis risk , with an 8% increase in arthritis risk for each interquartile range ( IQR ) increase in TG ( OR=08 ; 95% CI , 039 ) Interquartile analyses of TG levels showed a significant dose response trend ( P trend <05 ) , suggesting that the risk of arthritis tended to rise progressively with higher TG levels . Mediation analysis further revealed that HDL C mediated approximately 5% of the TG arthritis association , suggesting an important role of HDL C in the metabolic pathway of arthritis development . CONCLUSION : Elevated TG levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of arthritis , and this association was partially mediated by HDL C . The findings suggest that interventions targeting reduced TG levels and enhanced HDL function may have potential value in arthritis prevention . Future studies should focus on lipid metabolism intervention strategies to reduce arthritis risk and delay disease progression , providing a new scientific basis for arthritis management .
BACKGROUND : The triglyceride glucose ( TyG ) index has been confirmed to be a predictor of cardiovascular diseases . The present study aimed to assess the predictive value of TyG index for left ventricular aneurysm ( LVA ) formation and prognosis in patients with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . METHODS : This prospective study included 991 patients with acute STEMI who underwent primary PCI . Multivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis were used to assess the predictive value of TyG index for LVA formation . Prognosis analysis was performed with cox proportional hazard regression . RESULTS : The prevalence of LVA was 4% . A higher TyG index was associated with a greater incidence of LVA ( 1% vs . 8% , P< 001 ) . The TyG index was also higher in the LVA group than in the non LVA group ( 4 +/ 9 vs . 0 +/ 8 , P<001 ) . Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the TyG index was independently associated with the risk of LVA [odds ratio ( OR ) = 4 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) = 51 82 , P< 001] . The predictive value of the TyG index remained significant even after cross validation by dividing the study population into a training set ( OR= 32 , 95% CI= 24 35 , P= 009 ) and validation set ( OR= 19 , 95% CI= 42 19 , P= 005 ) . Higher TyG index was correlated with increased risk of cardiac death ( HR= 17 , P= 04 ) . The maximal length and width of LVA were significantly increased in patients with TyG index >/= 68 compared with < 68 ( P< 001 ) . The discriminant power of TyG index for LVA was 742 , which was superior to both triglyceride ( C statistic= 666 ) and fasting blood glucose ( C statistic= 613 ) . The combination of TyG index , left ventricular ejection fraction , gensini score , and left anterior descending artery as the culprit vessel could significantly improve the predictive ability ( C statistic= 908 ) . CONCLUSIONS : A higher TyG index was an independent predictor for LVA formation and increased risk of cardiac death in patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI .
BACKGROUND : Age related ovarian dysfunction , characterized by declining follicular reserve and hormonal imbalance , poses a significant challenge in reproductive endocrinology , severely compromising fertility and quality of life . Although acupuncture at conception vessel acupoints is an effective therapeutic approach for managing ovarian dysfunction , the biological underpinnings bridging peripheral stimulation to systemic endocrine regulation remain elusive . Emerging evidence has highlighted interstitial fluid ( ISF ) dynamics as a potential mediator of mechanotransduction . However , it remains to be elucidated whether ISF transport in the linea alba ( abdominal trajectory of conception vessel ) influences ovarian function , and whether acupuncture at conception vessel acupoints exerts its therapeutic effects through ISF mediated substance transport along the linea alba . METHODS : We used fluorescence imaging to observe ISF migration patterns in the linea alba of rats , where conception vessel acupoints are located . In addition , we investigated the ovarian functional changes post ISF obstruction and evaluated the therapeutic effects of acupuncture on ovarian dysfunction in aged rats , both in unblocked and ISF blockade conditions . RESULTS : Fluorescence imaging revealed ISF transport along the linea alba , with tracers migrating linearly , a pattern abolished by surgical blockade . Abnormal ISF transport in the linea alba may affect the homeostasis of reproductive hormone levels . Serum follicle stimulating and luteinizing hormones increased while E decreased , accompanied by follicular depletion and hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis dysregulation . Acupuncture at CV4 attenuated ovarian aging , elevating developmental follicle counts , reducing granulosa cell apoptosis , and restoring hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis function . Crucially , these therapeutic benefits were nullified under ISF blockade conditions . CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that ISF transport in the linea alba may serve as an important mechanistic pathway bridging acupuncture stimulation to ovarian regulation . Our study not only provides a mechanistic basis for the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in treating ovarian disorders but also identifies ISF dynamics as a novel therapeutic target in age related ovarian dysfunction .
OBJECTIVE : This systematic review and meta analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of traditional Chinese exercises ( TCEs ) on blood glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , and health related quality of life in older patients with diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . METHODS : Database searches were systematically conducted across multiple platforms . The review adhered to PRISMA guidelines , utilizing the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool to gauge literature quality . Review Manager 3 was employed for data evaluation , calculating mean differences to ascertain pooled effect sizes . RESULTS : This study encompassed 11 randomized controlled trials involving 944 individuals . The results showed that TCEs reduced fasting blood glucose ( 76 , 95% CI [ 14 , 38] , P = 0001 ) , HbA1c ( 64 , 95% CI [ 81 , 47] , P = 02 ) , and BMI ( 83 , 95% CI [ 42 , 24] , P = 006 ) , and improved health related quality of life . Among the various forms of TCEs , Baduanjin ( BDJ ) appeared particularly beneficial . CONCLUSIONS : Traditional Chinese exercises can improve blood glucose levels , BMI and quality of life related indicators to varying degrees in older diabetes patients , and may be a useful complementary therapy for this population .
AIM : To investigate the association of pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 ( PDX1 ) in early pregnancy with the risks of gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) and adverse pregnancy outcomes . METHODS : A total of 231 pregnant women were recruited at their initial antenatal care visit during 8 12 gestational weeks in this study . The 75g OGTT was performed during 24 28 gestational weeks . Blood samples were collected to measure PDX1 levels . Participants were followed throughout their pregnancy to monitor for the development of GDM and adverse pregnancy outcomes . The odds ratio ( OR ) was used to assess the risks of GDM and adverse pregnancy outcomes . RESULTS : Pregnant women in the GDM group had higher levels of HOMA IR and TyG index , and lower PDX1 levels both in early and mid pregnancy ( P<05 ) , but had lower HOMA beta levels only in mid pregnancy ( P<05 ) . PDX1 in early pregnancy was negatively correlated with FPG , 2h PG , HOMA IR , and TyG , while positively correlated with HOMA beta in mid pregnancy ( P<05 ) . The adjusted analysis showed that elevated PDX1 levels in early pregnancy were associated with reduced risks of GDM ( aOR 287 , 95%CI 130 636 , P=002 ) , macrosomia ( aOR 249 , 95%CI 076 811 , P=021 ) and composite adverse pregnancy outcomes ( aOR 496 , 95%CI 256 960 , P=037 ) . CONCLUSION : Elevated PDX1 in early pregnancy was associated with decreased risks of GDM and adverse pregnancy outcomes .
BACKGROUND : Insulinomas , the most common functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors , cause hypoglycemia due to excessive insulin production , leading to severe clinical symptoms like coma or death . Resection surgery is the major curative treatment , but preoperative localization is challenging due to their small size . Traditional imaging methods like computed tomography ( CT ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) often fail to detect tumors , while more invasive procedures like endoscopic ultrasound tissue acquisition ( EUS TA ) and the selective arterial calcium stimulation test ( SACST ) , though informative , depend heavily on operator skill and may not always provide conclusive results . There is an urgent need for non invasive , sensitive localization methods for insulinomas . Glucagon like peptide 1 receptor ( GLP 1R ) targeted PET imaging has emerged as a promising tool . We present a clinical case where [F] FB ( ePEG12 ) 12 exendin 4 positron emission tomography/CT ( F exendin 4 PET/CT ) successfully detected insulinoma , unachievable by conventional imaging , underscoring its potential in guiding minimally invasive surgery . CASE DESCRIPTION : A 67 year old female developed hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia but could not undergo surgery as conventional imaging methods failed to localize the insulinoma . She was managed with diazoxide for six years , but her symptoms worsened . At 73 , she was referred to our hospital . CT , MRI , endoscopic ultrasound , and SACST failed to detect the tumor in any artery . However , F exendin 4 PET/CT revealed a nodule with uptake in the dorsal pancreas , suspected to be the culprit lesion . The patient underwent surgery , and although the tumor appeared discontinuous with the pancreas macroscopically , histopathology confirmed it was microscopically continuous , identifying it as a primary pancreatic insulinoma . Post surgery , she achieved complete remission of symptoms and fully recovered . DISCUSSION : This case demonstrates the utility of F exendin 4 PET/CT , a novel GLP 1 receptor targeted imaging technique , in accurately localizing an occult insulinoma even with negative findings of SACST , enabling minimally invasive curative surgery . CONCLUSION : The F exendin 4 PET/CT successfully localized an insulinoma undetectable by other methods , enabling minimally invasive curative resection . This technique offers a valuable diagnostic option for enabling minimally invasive surgery in occult insulinoma cases .
BACKGROUND : A common pathophysiological association between lipid metabolism and sex hormone levels has been revealed in recent research . The atherogenic index of plasma ( AIP ) is the marker currently used to evaluate metabolism . The purpose of this research was to discover the relationship between the AIP and testosterone deficiency ( TD ) in a nationwide representative population . METHODS : Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) database from 2011 to 2016 were utilized in this cross sectional research . The formula , lg [TG ( mmol/L ) /HDL C ( mmol/L ) ] , was applied to determine the AIP . Total serum testosterone levels were used to define TD . Our researcher utilized smoothed curve fitting and multivariate logistic or linear regression analysis to inspect the relationship between AIP and TD among adult males . The consistency of these results was examined in various population subgroups . RESULTS : In total , 1 , 198 individuals ( 6% ) were stratified into the TD group . We observed statistically significant differences ( P values < 05 ) in the TD population for all variables . After correcting for potential confounders , our researchers discovered a strong positive relationship between the AIP and the probability of developing TD . With each additional unit of the AIP , the incidence of TD increased by 81 fold in adult males . Subgroup analyses showed the correlations for the majority of the subgroups remained stable . However , marital status , CKD , smoking , and alcohol consumption may modify this association . CONCLUSIONS : A higher AIP is correlated with a lower level of testosterone in adult males . This correlation may be altered by factors including marriage , chronic kidney disease , alcohol , and smoking consumption .
OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment at the collaborative National Standardized Metabolic Disease Management Center . METHODS : A nationally standardized selection process was used to recruit the healthcare team , followed by standardized training and assessment . The management center was equipped with coordinated healthcare resources , and clear workflows and responsibilities were established . A quality control management model was implemented throughout all stages . A convenience sample of 452 patients treated at the center between January 2018 and July 2023 was selected . After one year of management , a self comparison was conducted to evaluate the impact of one stop diagnosis and management on patients ' weight , fasting blood glucose , glycated hemoglobin , blood pressure , blood lipids , diet , and exercise . RESULTS : After one year of management , patients showed significant reductions in weight , BMI , waist circumference , and visceral fat compared to baseline data ( P=000 ) . Fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels decreased significantly ( P<0001 ) , as did systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( P<05 ) . Triglycerides , low density lipoprotein cholesterol , and total cholesterol levels also decreased significantly ( P<05 ) , but high density lipoprotein levels did not change significantly ( P=5298 ) . Improvements were observed in dietary and exercise behaviors ( P<05 ) , though no significant change was observed in salt intake ( P=648 ) . CONCLUSION : The collaborative model at the National Standardized Metabolic Disease Management Center enhances comprehensive patient management . Combined with lifestyle guidance on diet and exercise , the model improves the prevention and control of glycemic and lipid metabolism indicators in diabetes patients .
Vegetarian diets are gaining popularity worldwide , especially among women and in the younger part of the population , rising some concerns for the risk of inadequate iodine requirements if the diet is not correctly planned . Indeed , subjects under vegetarian dietary regimens , mainly the vegan ones , are at risk of developing both iodine deficiency and excess , due to lack of animal derived foods on the one hand , and to the use of vegan alternatives ( such as seaweed ) and over the counter supplements on the other hand . Women in childbearing age and children are particularly vulnerable to the adverse thyroid consequences . Thus , this paper aims to provide some practical information to achieve adequate iodine intake and avoid adverse effects on thyroid in this population .
BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular kidney metabolic ( CKM ) syndrome reflects the interplay among metabolic risk factors , chronic kidney disease , and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . While the hemoglobin glycation index ( HGI ) has demonstrated prognostic value for cardiovascular events , its clinical utility remains unexplored in early stage CKM syndrome . METHODS : Participants with early stage CKM syndrome ( stage 0 3 ) were recruited from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study ( CHARLS ) database . Using k means clustering analysis , the participants were classified according to the values of HGI measured at baseline and 3 years later , respectively . The primary outcome was self reported CVD during the follow up of at least 3 years . Extreme gradient boosting ( XGBoost ) algorithm was applied , with the Shapley additive explanation ( SHAP ) method used to determine feature importance . Multivariable logistics proportional regression analysis the association between HGI and CVD , and restricted cubic spline ( RCS ) regression assessed potential nonlinear relationships . RESULTS : A total of 4676 eligible participants were included in the final analysis , with 944 ( 19% ) progressed to CVD within 10 years . Among the baseline clinical features , HGI ranked the second for the impact on the occurrence of CVD . According to the changes of HGI values , the participants were clustered into 4 classes . Compared to the class 1 with lower level of HGI , higher risk of CVD was observed in class 3 ( adjusted OR : 34 , 95% CI : 06 69 , P = 013 ) and class 4 ( adjusted OR : 65 , 95% CI : 01 45 , P = 025 ) with higher and rapidly increasing level of HGI . RCS analysis showed cumulative HGI and the risk of CVD were linearly related ( P for nonlinearity = 967 ) . Subgroup analyses confirmed the stability of the association . Additionally , the SHAP plot revealed that HGI were the more important features than traditional risk factors such as FBG for predicting CVD . CONCLUSION : HGI is associated with an elevated risk of CVD in participants with early stage CKM syndrome . HGI can serve as an independent biomarker for guiding clinical decision making and managing patient outcomes .
Osteoarthritis ( OA ) , the most prevalent joint disorder associated with aging , is characterized by impaired extracellular matrix ( ECM ) synthesis and the degradation of articular cartilage . It is influenced by various factors , including aging and mechanical stress ( such as traumatic injury ) . Increasing evidence suggests that alterations in cartilage stiffness occur during OA progression , particularly at its onset . This review comprehensively examines how aging and mechanical stress contribute to ECM stiffening , a precursor to irreversible cartilage degradation . We also discuss how increased matrix stiffness disrupts the homeostatic balance between chondrocyte catabolism and anabolism and the mechanotransduction pathways involved in cartilage stiffening . Furthermore , the potential of cartilage engineering to target the stiffness of synthetic materials is explored as a promising approach to advancing cartilage repair and regeneration in OA . A deeper understanding of this research area may not only lead to more innovative strategies for early OA detection and diagnosis but also offer novel insights into OA treatment and prognosis .
BACKGROUND : The non high density lipoprotein cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio ( NHHR ) is an emerging composite lipid marker . Prediabetes , characterized by an asymptomatic state with moderate hyperglycemia , is more prevalent than diabetes . This study aimed to elucidate the potential correlation between NHHR and the risk of diabetes and prediabetes among adults with hypertension . METHODS : In this cross sectional survey , we screened National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) collected data during 2009 2018 , identifying a qualifying population of 10 , 250 individuals . Weighted multivariate logistic regression and curve fitting evaluated the correlation between the NHHR and the incidence of diabetes and prediabetes . To test differences between subgroups , stratified analyses were performed . Additionally , prediction accuracy of the NHHR was assessed using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves . RESULTS : We included 10 , 250 patients with hypertension ( mean age , 31 +/ 06 years ) including 2 , 198 with diabetes and 4 , 138 with prediabetes a combined prevalence of 81% . The fully adjusted model indicated each unit increase in NHHR was associated with a 21% higher risk of diabetes/prediabetes ( OR 21 ; 95% CI , 15 25 ) . Adjustment using multivariable classification models revealed that compared to the lowest NHHR quartile , the odds increased by 41% ( OR 37 ; 95% CI , 27 59 , p<001 ) in Q3 and ( OR 82 ; 95% CI , 62 98 , p<001 ) in Q In patients with hypertension , the NHHR was positively correlated with the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes , with a nonlinear trend in the fitted curve ( nonlinearity , P=007 ) . The threshold effect analysis showed that the inflection point for NHHR and the risk of diabetes and prediabetes was In particular , when NHHR was below 09 , a positive correlation was found between NHHR and the risk of diabetes and prediabetes in this population ( OR 34 ; 95% CI , 28 39 ) . Subgroup analyses showed consistent associations across most groups , with a significant interaction in sex . CONCLUSIONS : NHHR is positively and non linearly correlated with diabetes/prediabetes in patients with hypertension , particularly among women . It may serve as a valuable tool for early risk assessment and management .
BACKGROUND : Thyroid hormones impact on metabolic homeostasis , and low thyroid hormone levels , both systemically and hepatically , have been linked to hepatic steatosis . However , prior studies in this area often lacked quantification of steatosis . Ultrasound attenuation analysis ( USAT ) is a novel imaging technique for hepatic steatosis detection based on the attenuation coefficient . Our objective in this study was to assess the correlation between thyroid hormone levels and hepatic steatosis via the USAT attenuation coefficient in metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease ( MASLD ) and chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) groups . METHODS : This retrospective study included 86 patients with CHB and 45 patients with suspicious MASLD . Demographic information , biochemical parameters , and thyroid hormone levels were analyzed . The severity of steatosis in MASLD or CHB was assessed by USAT . RESULTS : Patients in the MASLD group were more likely to have type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and hypertension as compared with those in the CHB group ( P<05 ) . The levels of triiodothyronine ( T3 ) were significantly lower and the platelet counts higher in the MASLD group than in the CHB group ( P<05 ) . The body mass index ( BMI ) , distance from skin to capsule , USAT values , and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) levels in patients with hepatic steatosis were significantly higher than those in patients without hepatic steatosis ( P<05 ) . Logistic regression analysis indicated a correlation between free triiodothyronine ( FT3 ) level and hepatic steatosis ( P=04 ) as well as between free thyroxine ( FT4 ) level and hepatic steatosis ( P=045 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Quantitative USAT evaluation suggested that hepatic steatosis is strongly correlated with thyroid hormones . These data emphasize the relevance of thyroid hormones for regulating hepatic lipid accumulation and metabolism .
It has been demonstrated that glutamine is a key player in boosting endothelial cell ( EC ) proliferation . However , despite its importance , the role of endothelial glutaminolysis in diabetes remains largely unexplored . Our research aimed to investigate the function of glutaminolysis in ECs within the context of diabetes and to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of salvianolic acid B ( SalB ) and alpha ketoglutarate ( alpha KG ) on diabetic vascular complications . Histological analysis of skin wounds in diabetic patients revealed delayed restoration of vascularization and collagen synthesis during wound healing , accompanied by decreased glutaminase 1 ( GLS1 ) expression and reduced colocalization with the EC marker platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 ( CD31 ) . Additionally , a significant decline in GLS1 activity and expression was observed in ECs isolated from diabetic hearts . In vitro studies using cultured ECs demonstrated that exposure to high glucose and high fat ( HGHF ) reduced GLS1 expression and suppressed glutaminolysis , impairing EC proliferation and tube formation . These adverse effects were mitigated by treatment with SalB or supplementation with alpha KG plus nonessential amino acids ( NEAAs ) . Among diabetic mice subjected to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion ( MI/R ) , SalB administration or alpha KG supplementation promoted myocardial revascularization and improved cardiac dysfunction . Notably , endothelial specific GLS1 deletion in mice blocked the beneficial effects afforded by SalB but not those afforded by alpha KG . Furthermore , SalB administration accelerated angiogenesis and cutaneous wound healing in diabetic mice , and these influences were removed by pharmacological inhibition of GLS1 using bis 2 ( 5 phenylacetamido 1 , 3 , 4 thiadiazol 2 yl ) ethyl sulfide ( BPTES ) or genetic deletion of endothelial GLS These findings indicate that defective endothelial glutaminolysis contributes to impaired angiogenesis and poor ischemic tissue repair in diabetes . Improving endothelial glutaminolysis by treatment with SalB or metabolic supplementation with alpha KG promotes angiogenesis and ischemic tissue repair in diabetic mice , emphasizing the possibility of GLS1 as a treatment target .
Neoadjuvant therapy before surgery offers varying benefits as a well established treatment option for breast cancer . This study specifically evaluated the effectiveness of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy ( NET ) , neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NCT ) , and neoadjuvant chemo endocrine therapy ( NCET ) in patients with estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive breast cancer . This meta analysis was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines . Electronic searching was conducted to retrieve articles from databases including PubMed , Cochrane Library , EMBASE , CNKI , and Wanfang . The primary outcome measured by odds ratios ( ORs ) with 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) focused on assessing pooled effect sizes . Random effects or fixed effect models were conducted according to the existence of statistical heterogeneity . A total of 15 eligible articles were included in the analysis . The results indicated clinical response ( CR ) ( OR = 54 ; 95% CI = 41 to 73 ; I = 6% ) and clinical complete response ( cCR ) ( OR = 31 ; 95% CI = 12 to 85 ; I = 0% ) after NET was significantly higher than NCT . However , no significant difference was shown in pathological complete response ( pCR ) ( OR = 49 ; 95% CI = 23 to 04 ; I = 0% ) and breast conserving surgery ( BCS ) ( OR = 49 ; 95% CI = 23 to 04 ; I = 0% ) . The combined paradigm of NCET presented no significant improvement compared with monotherapy of NET or NCT . Overall , both NET and NCT are effective neoadjuvant treatment options for patients with ER+ breast cancer . More explicit clinical decision indicators need to be further clarified . And NCET does not offer additional benefits over NET or NCT in patients with ER+ breast cancer .
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) is a key target for metabolic disorders that contribute to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . However , full agonists such as thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) have limitations in terms of side effects . Selective PPARgamma modulators ( SPPARgammaMs ) that target alternative binding pockets offer the potential for safer partial agonists . Here , we employed six computational algorithms ( Fpocket , DeepSite , CavityPlus , DoGSiteScorer , CASTpFold , POCASA ) to identify a novel allosteric pocket ( pocket 6 5 ) in the PPARgamma ligand binding domain ( LBD ) , localized at the helix 3 ( H3 ) , helix 2 ( H2 ) , helix 2 ' ( H2 ' ) , and beta sheet interface . A virtual screening of 4 , 097 natural compounds from traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) libraries was conducted , which led to the identification of ginsenoside Rg5 ( TWSZ 5 ) as a top hit .

Acute pancreatitis ( AP ) is a potentially highly fatal inflammatory disease characterized by the generation of high level of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) of mass recruited inflammatory macrophages in pancreatic tissue . Many natural product antioxidants have been explored to treat AP due to their superiority in biosafety while the therapeutic application is restricted by their low ROS elimination as well as the rapid metabolism caused by small molecular weight and fast absorption . Herein , a new natural product based nano antioxidant ( FA@zein CS ) that can overcome these problems was developed for the treatment of AP by encapsulating ferulic acid ( FA ) into the zein based nanoparticles and then hybridizing of chondroitin sulfate ( CS ) . The FA@zein CS would not only efficiently target to the inflamed pancreatic tissue by the specific binding of CS to CD44 , but also effectively initiate the release of FA and zein degradation product in response to intracellular pH/GSH/ROS to achieve synergistic antioxidant effect . In addition , thanks to the fact that all components were derived from natural products , the FA@zein CS held the excellent biocompatibility . In vivo results disclosed that the FA@zein CS significantly reduced pancreatic structural damage and restored the pancreatic function with serum amylase and lipase reduced by 8% and 8% , respectively . This natural product based nano antioxidant holds great clinic potential for AP .
Aims/Background Bronchopneumonia is a common infectious disease in pediatrics , which can lead to myocardial and hepatic impairments . Children with bronchopneumonia accompanied by wheezing are vulnerable to hypoxia , which may damage other systems . Therefore , this study explored the influence of montelukast combined with methylprednisolone on liver function , platelet count , eosinophil count , and myocardial enzymes in children with bronchopneumonia accompanied by wheezing . Methods The clinical data of this retrospective study included 82 pediatric cases diagnosed with bronchopneumonia and wheezing between April 2022 and April Based on treatment methods , patients were divided into the methylprednisolone group ( 40 cases ) as well as the montelukast and methylprednisolone group ( 42 cases ) . Therapeutic efficacy , resolution time of clinical symptoms , and adverse effects were recorded . Furthermore , liver function indicators , platelet count , eosinophil count , and myocardial enzyme levels were comparatively assessed using biochemical analyzer , hematology analyzer and biological kits in both groups . Results The total efficacy rate of the montelukast and methylprednisolone group was 2% ( 40/42 ) , higher than the 5% of the methylprednisolone group ( p = 018 ) . Patients in the montelukast and methylprednisolone group had shorter hospitalization and clinical symptom disappearance times than the methylprednisolone group ( both p < 05 ) . In addition , there was no significant difference in total incidence of adverse reactions ( p = 700 ) . Methylprednisolone monotherapy or in combination with montelukast , substantially reduced liver function indicators , platelet count , eosinophil count , and myocardial enzyme levels ( p < 05 ) . Moreover , the platelet count , eosinophil count , and myocardial enzymes [aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , creatine kinase ( CK ) , and creatine kinase isoenzyme ( CK MB ) ] were reduced in the montelukast and methylprednisolone group compared to the methylprednisolone group after treatment ( p < 05 ) . Compared to the methylprednisolone group , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , total bilirubin ( TBIL ) , direct bilirubin ( DBIL ) levels were significantly diminished in the montelukast and methylprednisolone group following treatment ( p < 05 ) . Conclusion Montelukast and methylprednisolone combination therapy reduces platelet and eosinophil counts , alleviates myocardial and liver function damage , and demonstrates good therapeutic efficacy in children with bronchopneumonia accompanied by wheezing .

Aims/Background Uremia is a severe manifestation of end stage renal failure , with high cardiovascular risk , and current dialysis treatments like hemodialysis ( HD ) face limitations in toxin clearance , necessitating more effective therapeutic strategies . This study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of HD combined with hemodiafiltration ( HDF ) in treating uremia and its influence on cardiac ultrasound indices . Methods This study retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 80 uremic patients treated at the Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province affiliated to Wenzhou Medical University between April 2019 and April Based on different therapeutic regimens , patients were divided into a control group ( n = 41 ) and an observation group ( n = 39 ) . The control group received HD , while the observation group underwent HD combined with HDF . The cardiac structure , cardiac function , lipid metabolism , and other biochemical indicators were comparatively assessed between the two groups . Results There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups ( p > 05 ) . Before treatment , both groups demonstrated no significant difference in left atrial diameter ( LAD ) , left ventricular posterior wall thickness ( LVPWT ) , interventricular septal thickness ( IVST ) , left ventricular end diastolic diameter ( LVEDD ) , brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , and troponin T ( TnT ) ( p > 05 ) . However , after 6 months of treatment , these indices were significantly declined in the observation group ( p < 05 ) . Similarly , no significant differences were observed in left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , fractional shortening ( FS ) , cardiac output ( CO ) , stroke volume ( SV ) , and peak mitral E wave velocity/peak mitral A wave velocity ( E/A ) before treatment ( p > 05 ) . However , a significant improvement was observed in the observation group following 6 months of treatment ( p < 05 ) . Before treatment , there were no significant differences in serum creatinine ( Scr ) , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , beta2 microglobulin ( beta2 MG ) , and parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) between the two groups ( p > 05 ) . However , the observation group showed significant improvements in Scr , BUN , beta2 MG , and PTH after treatment ( p < 001 ) . Additionally , the two study groups had no significant differences in total cholesterol ( TC ) , triglycerides ( TG ) , and low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) before treatment ( p > 05 ) . However , their levels decreased significantly in the observation group after treatment ( p < 05 ) . Hypertension and hypotension occurred less frequently in the observation group ( p < 05 ) , with no significant differences observed in the incidence of arrhythmia and infection between the two groups ( p > 05 ) . Conclusion HD combined with HDF effectively improves cardiac structure and function , reduces metabolic wastes such as Scr , BUN and beta2 MG , and decreases blood lipid levels in uremic patients . This study further confirmed the clinical efficacy of this combined approach in treating uremia , which is of positive significance for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases in uremic patients .

Aims/Background The C reactive protein to albumin ratio ( CAR ) has traditionally been employed to assess inflammatory status in non cardiac diseases . Recent clinical studies suggest that CAR is a valuable indicator of inflammation in atherosclerotic coronary artery diseases . However , its relationship with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) remains unclear . This study aimed to investigate the relationship between CAR and the exact location of the culprit lesion in STEMI patients and its potential clinical implications . Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who presented with STEMI and were treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) within 12 hours of symptom onset between November 2018 and November Based on coronary angiography ( CAG ) findings , patients were categorized into three groups according to the culprit vessel : left anterior descending artery ( LAD ) ( n = 218 ) , left circumflex artery ( LCX ) ( n = 31 ) , and right coronary artery ( RCA ) ( n = 153 ) . Three patients with ramus occlusion were excluded from the subgroup analysis . Furthermore , based on the lesion location within the culprit vessel , patients were divided into proximal ( n = 122 ) , middle ( n = 222 ) , and distal ( n = 61 ) segment groups . Clinical baseline characteristics and laboratory results were recorded . Statistical analyses , including analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) , the Kruskal Wallis H test , Fisher ' s exact test , and the chi square test , were performed based on variable types and distribution . Correlation analysis was conducted using Spearman ' s rank correlation coefficient . The receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve was applied to determine the optimal cut off value for CAR . A p value < 05 was considered statistically significant . Results A total of 405 patients were included in the study . CAR and left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) showed significant differences across groups stratified by culprit vessels ( p = 001 for CAR ; p < 001 for LVEF ) and lesion location within the vessels ( p < 001 for CAR and LVEF ) . CAR values were higher in more proximally located lesions ( r = 218 , p < 001 ) , while LVEF showed an inverse relationship ( r = 203 , p < 001 ) . ROC curve analysis showed that CAR could predict proximal and mid vessel lesions in STEMI patients , with a cut off value of 16 ( area under the curve [AUC] : 662 , 95% confidence interval [CI] : 59 74 , p < 001 ) . Conclusion CAR is an easily calculable and reliable biomarker associated with culprit lesion location in STEMI patients , providing potential clinical utility in risk stratification and disease assessment .

Aims/Background Sjogren ' s syndrome ( SS ) is a highly prevalent autoimmune disease with potentially serious consequences if left untreated , but methods for early detection and prevention of SS remain limited . This study aims to investigate the causal relationships between serum metabolites and SS using Mendelian randomization ( MR ) , focusing on identifying key metabolic pathways and biomarkers that contribute to SS pathogenesis . Methods We used a two sample MR approach to investigate the causal relationships between serum metabolites and SS . The primary method for estimating these causal effects was inverse variance weighting ( IVW ) , with results presented alongside their corresponding 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) . Sensitivity analyses included the Cochran ' s Q statistical analysis and MR Egger method . Furthermore , an enrichment analysis of metabolic pathways was applied to the identified metabolites . Results Thirty seven serum metabolites that have causal links with SS , encompassing 7 metabolite ratios and 30 single metabolites ( 4 unknown and 26 known ) , were identified . Metabolite ratios , reflecting the balance between specific metabolites , were analyzed to identify metabolic shifts that may contribute to SS pathogenesis . Among the 26 known metabolites , 12 are protective factors and 14 are risk factors . The levels of cis 4 decenoate ( cDA ) ( 10 : 1n6 ) ( odds ratio [OR] = 125 ; 95% CI = 026 233 ; p = 012 ) is positively correlated with the incidence of SS , whereas the levels of butyrate/isobutyrate ( 4 : 0 ) ( OR = 822 ; 95% CI = 701 963 ; p = 016 ) are negatively correlated with the SS incidence . Most of these metabolites are associated with lipid and amino acid metabolism . Among lipids , the strongest risk increasing factor was 2 , 3 dihydroxy 2 methylbutyrate ( OR = 307 ; 95% CI = 054 621 ; p = 015 ) , while the strongest risk decreasing factor was hexadecadienoate ( 16 : 2n6 ) ( OR = 774 ; 95% CI = 635 944 ; p = 011 ) . Among amino acids , the strongest risk increasing factor was N acetylproline ( OR = 178 ; 95% CI = 024 355 ; p = 022 ) , and the strongest risk decreasing factor was N acetylserine ( OR = 802 ; 95% CI = 694 926 ; p = 003 ) . Furthermore , these metabolites are predominantly enriched in the arginine and proline metabolism pathway . Conclusion This study helped enhance our comprehension of the causal relationship between serum metabolites and SS , showing that some metabolites may influence the risk and development of this disease . These insights offer novel perspectives for the development of SS prediction and diagnosis . FAU Li , Yuqiao
Magnetic fields ( MF ) exert a considerable influence on biological processes in various organisms , including prominent effects on plant growth and development . Plant responses to MFs are highly diverse , implying that a plethora of processes are affected , hampering their molecular characterization . In this report , we employed the well characterized plant model Arabidopsis thaliana to determine root growth responses to both static magnetic fields ( SMF ) and gradient magnetic fields ( Gradient MF ) . SMF exposure resulted in a dosage dependent inhibition of root elongation growth and altered auxin responsive reporter expression , whilst Gradient MF exposure interfered with root curvature and auxin signaling under conditions of minimized gravity effects . Mutants deficient in components of the Arabidopsis auxin transport machinery were less responsive to MFs than wild type , indicative of MF induced effects on polar auxin transport . When viewing the subcellular localization of PIN FORMED ( PIN ) auxin efflux transporters in root meristems , we found that MFs impact their subcellular distribution in root cap and epidermis cells . These effects on PIN localization hint at a molecular switch , linking cellular protein dynamics , auxin transport , and morphogenesis , by which MFs impact the growth of higher plants .
Myeloid derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) are a heterogeneous population of pathologically expanded immature myeloid cells originating from bone marrow precursors , characterized by their potent immunosuppressive activity through mechanisms such as T cell inhibition , cytokine dysregulation , and metabolic interference . These cells are critically implicated in diverse pathological contexts , including cancer progression , chronic infections , and inflammatory disorders . In chronic liver diseases , MDSCs contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple conditions , such as chronic viral hepatitis , alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , and autoimmune liver diseases ( AILD ) . Emerging evidence highlights their dual roles in both exacerbating tissue injury and modulating immune responses , positioning MDSCs as pivotal regulators of disease progression and potential therapeutic targets . In this review , we summarize the biological roles of MDSCs in a variety of chronic inflammatory liver diseases and explore the therapeutic potential of targeting these diseases to provide new insight for the treatment of chronic liver diseases .
Crosslinking gives hyaluronic acid ( HA ) the ability to resist digestion by hyaluronidase ; thus , crosslinked hyaluronic acid ( cHA ) is currently the most popular soft tissue filler . Clinically trained physicians usually administer cHA to the desired site via injections . Injection into the upper dermis and epidermis layers of the skin is challenging , and cHA with a low level of crosslinking is employed to prevent the uneven look , but it comes with a shorter lifetime . We demonstrate here the synthesis of cHA and its simultaneous fabrication into cHA detachable microneedles ( cHA DDMNs ) . The cHA DDMN patch allowed for the deposition of cHA into the ex vivo porcine skin in 1 min . The non crosslinked HA placed into the ex vivo porcine skin spread out evenly within 30 min after it was applied . In contrast , the deposited cHA demonstrated prolonged localization in the tissue . Furthermore , we demonstrated the sustained release of curcumin delivered by cHA both in vitro and ex vivo . In rats , the administration of cHA DDMNs to the skin did not cause skin irritation and led to a significant increase in dermal thickness and collagen deposition .
Micro/nano topographies ( MNTs ) of biomaterials are well known to influence osteoblast differentiation , although the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood . Piezo1 is involved in mechanotransduction in various cell types , and we hypothesized that Piezo1 may play a key role in osteogenic differentiation through the NFATc1 Wnt/beta catenin or YAP signaling pathways . To test this hypothesis , polished titanium plates ( PT ) and titanium plates with TiO nanotubes ( TNT 30 and TNT 100 ) were used . Experimental results showed that TNT 100 increased the gene expression and activation of Piezo1 , upregulating osteogenic genes such as NFATc1 , Wnt3a , and beta catenin , and promoting the nuclear localization of NFATc1 , beta catenin , and YAP compared to PT . The influx of Ca ( 2+ ) through Piezo1 , activated by MNTs , initiated the signaling cascades . Furthermore , compared to TRPV4 , another recently reported mediator in MNTs stimulated osteogenic differentiation , Piezo1 responded to MNTs much faster . These findings suggest that Piezo1 acts as an early mediator of osteogenic differentiation stimulated by MNTs in BMSCs .
A cystathionine beta synthase ( CBS ) gene , FpCBS , of the wheat crown rot pathogen , Fusarium pseudograminearum , was identified . FpCBS was highly expressed during conidiation and the early phases of infection . Compared to the wild type and FpCBS complemented strains , the FpCBS deletion strain had a similar hyphal morphology and growth rate but reduced conidiation . In culture , the FpCBS deletion strain showed broad scale changes with a decrease in HS levels , changes in sulphur containing amino acids and 1207 differentially expressed proteins . The deletion strain also showed reduced deoxynivalenol ( DON ) production , cellophane penetration ability , antioxidant capacity , as well as increased hyphal iron levels , sensitivity to HO and lipid peroxidation . During infection , the DeltaFpcbs strain showed diminished virulence to wheat with fewer penetration structures , and there was a stronger host defence response with wheat epidermal cells having thickened walls and greater reactive oxygen species accumulation . Transcriptomic analysis of infected leaves showed 1954 differentially expressed genes in the FpCBS deletion strain compared to the wild type strain . This included genes for sulphur metabolism , antioxidative defence , plant cell wall degrading enzymes and trichothecene production . FpCBS not only plays a pivotal role in sulphur metabolism and HS production , but it is also important for a broad range of fungal functions , including iron homoeostasis , mycotoxin production and development ( conidiation and penetration structures ) . These factors may all contribute to varying extents to the significant decrease in virulence of the FpCBS deletion strain . The findings have shown that FpCBS is important for much more than sulphur metabolism and HS synthesis . However , its role in virulence highlights its potential as a novel target for developing strategies to control wheat crown rot .
BACKGROUND : Metabolic and bariatric surgery ( MBS ) procedures with extended biliary limb length are gaining popularity to expedite weight loss but can induce liver failure . We aimed to investigate the underlying pathophysiology for this potentially fatal complication . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We compared mouse models of vertical sleeve plication , sleeve gastrectomy , Roux en Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , and one anastomosis gastric bypass with three biliary limb lengths ( 25% = Omega1 , 50% = Omega2 , 75% = Omega3 ) by analyzing mortality , weight loss , metabolic and liver health , bacterial translocation , inflammation , and biliary and fecal microbiome . Gut decontamination with oral antibiotics ( amoxicillin , vancomycin , neomycin , and metronidazole ) was performed in a subset of Omega3 mice . Liver histology from mice with different biliary limb lengths was compared to samples from human patients who developed liver failure following biliopancreatic diversion or RYGB . RESULTS : RYGB and Omega1&2 significantly improved glucose intolerance and liver steatosis compared to sham surgery . However , extending the biliary limb ( Omega3 ) resulted in 100% mortality . The Omega3 procedure induced bacterial translocation of enterococcus genus to the spleen and biliary fluid , consistent with increased serum lipopolysaccharide levels and terminal ileum , biliary limb , and hepatic inflammation . Liver histology in Omega3 mice was characterized by mediovesicular steatosis , closely resembling the histological picture observed in patients with liver failure after MBS . Oral gut decontamination significantly improved Omega3 one week survival from 3% to 0% , prevented bacterial overgrowth in biliary fluid and spleen , and decreased liver damage . CONCLUSION : Mortality in longer biliary limb MBS surgery is caused by bacterial overgrowth , translocation , and gut liver axis inflammation , which were reversed by oral gut decontamination with antibiotics .
OBJECTIVE : To detect the potential association between the dietary index for gut microbiota ( DI GM ) and hyperuricemia . METHOD : Utilizing cross sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) data , a multivariable logistic regression model was employed to reveal the impact of DI GM on uric acid levels . The results indicate that participants with hyperuricemia had significantly lower DI GM levels compared to those without hyperuricemia ( OR = 93 , 95% CI : 91 95 , p < 001 ) . Furthermore , even after adjusting for covariates , the association between DI GM and hyperuricemia remained significant ( OR = 97 , 95% CI : 95 99 , p = 012 ) , suggesting a risk factor association between high DI GM and low uric acid levels . The study also revealed a gradual decrease in the risk of hyperuricemia with increasing DI GM , indicating the potential of DI GM as a prognostic assessment marker ( p for overall < 001 ) . Additionally , a weak negative correlation between DI GM and chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) was observed among patients with hyperuricemia ( Adjusted OR = 90 , 95% CI : 82 99 , p = 027 ) . CONCLUSION : These findings support the utility of DI GM as a potential biomarker with important implications for the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia . This discovery provides a crucial basis for the development of future dietary interventions and strategies related to gut microbiota , warranting further in depth research to validate its applicability and effectiveness in diverse populations .
PURPOSE OF REVIEW : As global life expectancy increases , age related neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia impose an increasing public health and socioeconomic burden . Maintaining a healthy lifestyle , particularly through a healthy diet , may reduce cognitive decline and support cognitive performance in aging populations . Despite increasing interest in dietary interventions as a strategy to enhance cognitive performance , research findings remain inconclusive . This narrative review aims to synthesize evidence on the longer term effects ( published February 2023 October 2024 ) and underlying mechanisms of dietary intervention strategies on cognitive performance in adults with preexisting cognitive impairment . RECENT FINDINGS : Recent evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that both single and multifactor dietary interventions may improve one or more cognitive domains in aging adults with preexisting cognitive impairment . However , variability in intervention types , durations , and participant characteristics limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions . SUMMARY : This review highlights the potential benefits of longer term dietary interventions on cognitive performance in adults with cognitive impairment . It further integrates emerging mechanistic insights , suggesting that specific dietary components may exert neuroprotective effects primarily by reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation , and by enhancing brain vascular function . These mechanisms may promote neuroplasticity through the modulation of neurotrophic signaling pathways . Future research should focus on replicating these findings to validate their efficacy and the underlying mechanisms involved . This is essential for integrating dietary approaches into evidence based guidelines for promoting long term cognitive health .
Colonic permeability is a major consequence of dysbiosis and diseases affecting the colon , further contributing to inflammation and extraintestinal diseases . Recent advances have shed light on the association between colonocyte energy utilization and the mechanisms that support epithelial function and homeostasis . One unifying theme is the induction of colonocyte hypoxia , driven by the aerobic oxidation of microbial derived butyrate , as a critical factor promoting multiple cellular processes that support intestinal barrier function , mucus secretion , and the maintenance of synergistic luminal microbes . Particular attention will be focused on experimental evidence supporting beta oxidation via activation of peroxisome proliferators activated receptor gamma ( PPAR ) and upregulation and activation of processes that promote barrier function by hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) signaling . Growing evidence suggests that colonocyte energy utilization is tightly regulated and switches between beta oxidation of butyrate and anaerobic glycolysis , the latter being associated with several disease states . As most of the primary literature associated with colonocyte energy utilization has focused on adult models , evidence supporting butyrate oxidation in the neonatal gut is lacking . Thus , this review details the current state of knowledge linking colonocyte substrate utilization to mechanisms supporting gut health , but also highlights the counterindications of colonic butyrate availability and utilization in developmental periods .

ObjectiveThe potential benefit of measures to prevent contrast induced acute kidney injury ( CIAKI ) remains uncertain . This uncertainty is partly due to the reliance on serum creatinine , a biomarker influenced by non renal factors such as muscle mass , hydration status , and age . Therefore , this study aims to evaluate CIAKI prevention based on cystatin C levels a more stable and earlier biomarker of renal dysfunction , which may improve diagnostic precision and the assessment of therapeutic efficacy . MethodsWe performed a systematic review and meta analysis of all randomized clinical trials ( RCTs ) on preventive measures of contrast induced acute kidney injury , based on cystatin C levels , in patients who underwent percutaneous procedures . We searched PubMed , Scopus , and Cochrane Central for studies comparing the use of high dose statins in prevention . The outcome of interest was an acute kidney injury based on increased serum cystatin C after the procedure . Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan This systematic review with meta analysis was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews ( PROSPERO ) under protocol ( CRD42023441815 ) . ResultsWe included four studies with a total of 1167 patients , of whom 594 ( 8% ) received high dose statins ( atorvastatin or rosuvastatin ) . On the baseline characteristics of the study population , 65% were male ; 2% had hypertension ; 3% had diabetes ; 7% had dyslipidemia , and 4% were currently smokers . Overall , high doses of statins were associated with a lower incidence the CIAKI ( OR 31 ; 95% CI [19 , 53] ; P < . 0001 ) . ConclusionOur findings suggest that high doses of statins may play an important role as a measure to prevent CIAKI . If this result is confirmed , we will be able to set up CIAKI prevention protocols , thus expanding the number of patients who will undergo contrast enhanced exams . FAU Fernandes , Daniel Cesar M
ObjectiveTo determine whether serum glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) and neurofilament light chain ( NfL ) concentrations differ between adults with migraine and healthy controls . MethodsThis single center , cross sectional study was conducted from September 2020 to June Adults diagnosed with migraine and healthy controls were enrolled . Serum GFAP and NfL concentrations were quantified using an ultra sensitive single molecule array platform . Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders , including age , sex , body mass index and smoking status . ResultsWe assessed serum samples from 603 participants with migraine and 154 controls . Serum GFAP concentrations were 8% higher in the overall migraine group compared to controls ( 95% confidence interval = 4 5% ; P = 036 ) . Conversely , serum NfL concentrations did not differ between participants with migraine and controls ( difference : 4% ; 95% confidence interval = 9 to 6% ; p = 68 ) . Neither serum GFAP , nor NfL concentrations varied according to migraine subtype or headache status at the time of blood sampling . ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate a modest yet statistically significant increase in serum GFAP among adults with migraine , independent of migraine subtype , whereas serum NfL levels were comparable to those of controls . Further research is needed to clarify the neurobiological mechanisms underlying elevated serum GFAP in migraine . FAU Gozalov , Emil
ObjectiveGinsenoside Rg1 has demonstrated beneficial effects in myocardial ischemia reperfusion ( I/R ) injury . However , its potential anti arrhythmic role in ventricular arrhythmias remains unclear . MethodsIn this study , a whole cell patch clamp technique was employed to evaluate the effects of Rg1 on L type calcium current ( I ( CaL ) ) and ventricular arrhythmia . Western blot analysis was conducted to investigate the underlying signaling pathways involved . ResultsGinsenoside Rg1 inhibited I ( CaL ) in ventricular myocytes in a concentration dependent manner . Additionally , Rg1 alleviated the I/R induced increase in diastolic intracellular calcium concentration ( [Ca ( 2+ ) ]i ) and reduced calcium overload . Importantly , Rg1 decreased the incidence of ventricular tachycardia ( VT ) and ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) in I/R injury models . Mechanistically , these cardioprotective effects appear to be mediated via modulation of the cAMP PKA and PI3K AKT signaling pathways . ConclusionsRg1 may attenuate the deterioration of cardiac function during acute I/R injury , lower the susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias , and prevent their occurrence following I/R . These findings suggest that Rg1 holds therapeutic potential in the management of I/R induced ventricular arrhythmias . FAU Wang , Teng
Lung adenocarcinoma remains a significant public health concern , necessitating novel therapeutic approaches . Neuregulin 4 ( NRG4 ) , a secreted protein of the epidermal growth factor family , is recognized for its roles in metabolic regulation and anti inflammatory processes , suggesting therapeutic potential across various diseases . However , its specific function in lung adenocarcinoma progression is not well elucidated . Methods : We utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) database to examine correlations between NRG4 expression , epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) related genes , and overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients . The effects of recombinant NRG4 ( rNRG4 ) on cell migration and cancer progression were evaluated through Transwell assays , quantitative PCR , immunofluorescence , and immunohistochemistry . Additionally , a lung adenocarcinoma mouse model ( LLC bearing ) was employed to assess the impact of rNRG4 on tumor progression . RNA sequencing of primary tumors was conducted to explore the functional mechanisms underlying rNRG4 ' s effects . Results : Our analysis revealed that NRG4 expression inversely correlates with key molecules involved in cell migration and EMT in lung adenocarcinoma . Treatment with rNRG4 significantly inhibited cell proliferation , migration , EMT , and tumor growth in both in vitro and in vivo models . RNA sequencing indicated that rNRG4 downregulates extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins , and online database analyses confirmed that higher NRG4 expression is associated with reduced ECM levels and improved patient survival . Conclusions : These findings suggest that NRG4 serves as a potential candidate for further investigation for lung adenocarcinoma . FAU Zhang , Shufan
BackgroundPrevious studies suggest that transient receptor potential melastatin 2 ( TRPM2 ) plays a protective role in sepsis by enhancing bacterial clearance . This effect is mediated through the modulation of macrophage phenotypic changes , which strengthen the immune response against infection . However , the specific role and underlying mechanism of TRPM2 in macrophage polarization during sepsis remain unclear . MethodCecal ligation and puncture ( CLP ) was used to establish a mouse sepsis model , and bone marrow derived macrophages ( BMDMs ) and peritoneal macrophages were prepared from C57BL/6 wild type and TRPM2 knockout ( trpm2 ( / ) ) mice . IPI549 was utilized as a specific inhibitor of PI3K . Macrophage polarization , bactericidal ability , and the PI3K/protein kinase B ( AKT ) /cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein signaling pathway were assessed . In addition , survival rate , bacterial burden , lung wet/dry weight ratio , lung and liver injury scores , and cytokine levels were measured in CLP induced septic mice . ResultsIn lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulated BMDMs , trpm2 deficiency increased the expression of characteristic markers associated with the M2b phenotype , reduced the bactericidal ability , and activated the PI3K/AKT/CREB signaling pathway . Consequently , both trpm2 ( / ) BMDMs and trpm2 ( / ) mice exhibited impaired bactericidal clearance during CLP induced sepsis . Furthermore , IPI549 attenuated TRPM2 deletion induced M2b polarization and restored the bactericidal function of BMDMs . Notably , IPI549 preconditioning reversed the increased susceptibility of the trpm2 ( / ) mice to sepsis . The 7 day mortality rate was 92% in trpm2 ( / ) mice , compared to 42% in IPI549 pretreated trpm2 ( / ) mice . Moreover , IPI549 treated mice exhibited improved lung wet/dry ratios , reduced lung and liver injury scores , reversed M2b polarization and decreased bacterial load . ConclusionThe PI3K/AKT/CREB pathway mediates the effect of TRPM2 by inhibiting M2b macrophage polarization and promoting bacterial clearance during sepsis . FAU Shen , Yanping
The placenta is vital for fetal growth , and its methylation patterns reflect placental function , affecting the fetus and providing insights into disease origins . While cord blood methylation is convenient for assessing the fetal environment , methylation profiles vary by tissue due to variance in cell populations , function , and life stage . As tissue differences extensively contribute to the DNA methylation patterns , using surrogate samples such as cord blood may result in inconsistent findings . In this study , we aim to quantify the correlation of cytosine phosphate guanine dinucleotides ( CpGs ) between paired cord blood and placenta samples . Using the Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip , we compared methylation patterns in cord blood mononuclear cells ( CBMC ; n = 54 ) , the maternally facing side of placental tissue ( MP ; n = 68 ) , and the fetal facing side of placental tissue ( FP ; n = 67 ) . Methylation patterns from the FP ( 6 , 021 CpGs ) were significantly correlated with CBMC compared to the MP ( 2 , 862 CpGs ) . These CpGs were related to the biological ( mitotic cell ) process and molecular function ( ribonucleoprotein complex binding ) . Our findings quantified CpG site correlation between cord blood and placenta , providing a valuable reference for future studies on placental health that rely on cord blood methylation in the absence of placental biospecimens .

Bacterial resistance represents one of the greatest challenges in modern medicine , requiring innovative strategies . This study presents the rational design of two synthetic analogue peptides , WK MAP1 , and WG MAP2 , inspired by the structure of the enzyme papain ( PDB 9PAP ) , emphasizing the novelty of using an enzyme as a model for developing new antimicrobials . Initially , in silico studies , including molecular modeling and docking experiments , revealed a high affinity of the peptides for mimetic bacterial membranes . Subsequently , in vitro assays confirmed their antimicrobial efficacy . WK MAP1 demonstrated superior activity against carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ( KPC+ ) , with a minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) of 25 muM , whereas WG MAP2 exhibited activity against both tested strains ( KPC+ and ATCC ) , with MICs of 50 and 100 muM , respectively . Both peptides effectively inhibited biofilm formation and exhibited low cytotoxicity in murine cells . This research highlights the potential of WK MAP1 and WG MAP2 as promising candidates for novel antimicrobial therapies , offering an innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of conventional antibiotics .
A previous study found that repeated intrauterine infusions of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) followed by an LPS infusion into the mammary glands attenuated the mammary inflammatory response . This suggests that repeated LPS infusion into the uterus promotes endotoxin tolerance ( ET ) in the mammary gland . However , the specific changes in mammary glands under ET conditions remain unclear . We hypothesized that ET affects leukocyte function in milk . This study aimed to investigate leukocyte function in milk under ET conditions induced through repeated LPS infusions into the uterus for three days followed by LPS infusion into the mammary glands of goats . Goats in the IU group ( n = 17 ) received an infusion of 100 mug LPS in 5 ml saline into the uterus for three consecutive days ( d 3 , 2 , and 1 ) , whereas the goats in the control group did not receive this infusion ( n = 19 ) . On d 0 , 1 mug LPS in 5 ml saline was infused into the mammary glands of both groups . Milk was collected 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 , and 120 h after LPS intramammary infusion . The IU group decreased cytokine production ( interleukin ( IL ) 1beta , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha , and IL 1Ra ) in milk following intramammary LPS infusion . Moreover , leukocyte activation , measured by phagocytic activity and CD11b expression , was higher in the IU group than in the control group . These findings suggest that goats exhibit enhanced leukocyte function in mammary glands under ET conditions , induced by repeated intrauterine infusion of LPS . FAU Jaisue , Jirapat
A series of 3 , 4 dimethoxybenzene based fibrate derivatives were designed and synthesized , which were screened for preliminary lipid lowering activity in a Triton WR 1339 induced hyperlipidemic mouse model . T5 had the strongest triglyceride ( TG ) and total cholesterol ( TC ) lowering effect among these target compounds . In a dose dependent study , the lowering effects of T5 on TG and TC were progressively enhanced with increasing doses administered . Further studies revealed that T5 had a hypolipidemic significant effect on high fat diet ( HFD ) induced hyperlipidemia mouse model , with substantial reductions in TG , TC , and low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL C ) levels , and a significant reduction in aspartate transaminase ( AST ) and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) levels in the liver , which had a protective effect on the liver . The of liver pathology showed that T5 could effectively inhibit lipid accumulation as well as inflammatory infiltration in the liver , thus reducing the degree of liver tissue damage . The expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha ( PPAR alpha ) , which regulates lipid metabolism , was significantly upregulated in liver tissues . Molecular docking assays also confirmed the high binding affinity between T5 and PPAR alpha active sites . In addition , T5 exhibited significant anti inflammatory and antioxidant effects . These findings suggest that T5 has multiple activities and may be a potential novel hypolipidemic drug with hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects .
Global floods in arsenic ( As ) stressed paddy fields affect rice productivity . Future predictions of flood related disasters provoke an urge to opt for climate smart varieties for a secure supply . Thus , this study is designed to present the mechanisms favoring a traditional variety Mini mansoori ( M . M ) to withstand the dual stress of As and submergence ( Sub ) . The investigation involved the identification of the key attributes regulating the physio biochemical shifts in 3 and 7 day ( d ) submerged plants . Our results indicated that at 3 days , gas film ( GF ) decrement correlated with reduced photosynthesis and Kreb cycle enzymes . This , in turn , stimulated anaerobic enzymes , salicylic acid , and gibberellic acid ( SA GA ) production , which increased glutamate metabolism through GDH enzyme , ultimately enhancing GABA and proline production to cover the energy gap . Proline dehydrogenase enzyme at 3 days monitored the stabilized proline turnover by catabolizing proline into glutamate while releasing reducing equivalents for additional ATP generation . However , at 7 days , further enhancement in GA content led to shoot elongation . The expanded GF and new leaf emergence recovered the photosynthetic machinery , TCA functioning , sugar reserves , and GABA content via proline homeostasis . This proline metabolic balance accentuated As tolerance and Sub resistance , henceforth presenting M . M . var . as climate smart for future crop improvements .
Brain derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) and secreted amyloid precursor protein alpha ( sAPPalpha ) promote neuronal growth but are lower in people with Alzheimer ' s Disease ( AD ) . BDNF increases after exercise , but the response may vary with exercise intensity and across blood fractions . While sAPPalpha rises post exercise in animals , its response to aerobic exercise in humans is unclear . This study examined how BDNF and sAPPalpha respond to moderate and high intensity exercise in healthy young adult humans . Participants completed three exercise conditions : moderate ( 65% Watt maximum , 30 min ) , clinical HIIT ( 4 x 4 min , 90% Watt maximum ) , and all out HIIT ( 8 x 30 s , 150% Watt maximum ) . Blood based biomarkers were extracted from venous blood drawn from venepuncture at baseline , immediately after exercise , and after 30 min rest . BDNF concentration was measured in serum , plasma , platelet poor plasma , and platelets ; sAPPalpha in serum via ELISAs . Data were primarily analyzed using mixed effects models . BDNF increased in plasma and platelet poor plasma across conditions but rose in serum only after clinical HIIT and moderate intensity exercise . BDNF concentration in platelets was unaffected . sAPPalpha increased after moderate and clinical HIIT sessions . Measurement of BDNF in serum alone may not fully represent the changes in BDNF post exercise . Further research is required in adults at risk of AD .
Heat therapy ( HT ) has been shown to induce physiological adaptations in muscle , including a reduction in the severity of muscle atrophy resulting from unloading . The muscle atrophy caused by unloading can be partially attributed to the dysregulation of Ca ( 2+ ) in the muscle cell , which can activate calpain mediated proteolysis . The sarco ( endo ) plasmic reticulum Ca ( 2+ ) ATPase ( SERCA ) is a primary regulator of Ca ( 2+ ) in muscle , and SERCA dysfunction has been repeatedly demonstrated in various models of muscle unloading . Heat shock protein 70 ( HSP70 ) is a heat inducible chaperone protein that binds to SERCA and protects against its dysfunction . While previous research has shown HT to upregulate HSP70 in rodent muscle , even in the unloaded state , the effects of HT on SERCA function in rodent skeletal muscle under these conditions remain unknown . Here , we characterized the effects of 4 weeks of HT on soleus muscle size , HSP70 expression , SERCA function , and maximal calpain activity in male C57BL/6J mice subjected to muscle unloading through tenotomy . Four weeks of HT preserved the cross sectional area of soleus myofibres following tenotomy , while also upregulating HSP70 , maintaining SERCA mediated Ca ( 2+ ) uptake , and reducing maximal calpain activity . Therefore , our research offers new insights into the advantages of HT for muscle health and physiology .
Sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor ) plays a critical role in global agriculture , serving as a staple food source and contributing significantly to various industries . However , sorghum cultivation faces significant challenges , particularly from pests like the sugarcane aphid ( SCA ) , which can cause substantial damage to crops . In this study , we investigated the role of the caffeoyl coenzyme A O methyltransferase ( CCoAOMT ) gene in sorghum defense against SCA . Feeding by SCA induced the expression of the SbCCoAOMT gene , which is involved in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway . Aphid no choice and choice bioassays revealed that SbCCoAOMT overexpression in sorghum resulted in reduced SCA reproduction and decreased aphid settling , respectively , compared to wild type ( RTx430 ) plants . Furthermore , electrical penetration graph ( EPG ) studies revealed that SbCCoAOMT overexpression restricts aphid feeding from the sieve elements . SCA feeding also induced the accumulation of lignin in sorghum wild type and SbCCoAOMT overexpression plants . Moreover , artificial diet aphid feeding bioassays with hydroxycinnamic acids , ferulic and sinapic acids , showed direct adverse effects on SCA reproduction . Our findings highlight the potential of genetic modification to enhance sorghum resistance to SCA and emphasize the importance of lignin related genes in plant defense mechanisms . This study offers valuable insights into developing aphid resistant sorghum varieties and suggests avenues for further research on enhancing plant defenses against biotic stresses .
AIMS : Acute myocarditis ( AM ) is a rare but severe disease affecting patients of all ages . Large multicentric studies comparing children and adults are currently lacking . We aimed to elucidate differences in presentation , management , and outcomes of AM across age groups . METHODS : We analysed a comprehensive French national cohort study , encompassing 53 paediatric and adult units from March 2020 to November 2021 , collecting data on baseline characteristics , evolution , management and in hospital complications . Myocarditis related events ( MRE ) within 30 days included all cause death , cardiogenic shock , cardiac arrest , ventricular arrhythmias or complete AV block . RESULTS : We included 745 AM patients ( 328 children and 417 adults ) , mainly male ( 4% ) with a median age of 9 years [Q1 Q3 ( 3 6 ) ] for children and 7 years [6 2] for adults . Multisystem inflammatory syndrome ( MIS ) was more prevalent among children ( 8% ) , and infectious aetiologies dominated in adults ( 4 vs . 4% ) . Children exhibited more severe clinical presentation ( 9 vs . 2% , P < 001 , with heart failure and 4 vs . 9% , P < 001 , with cardiogenic shock ) , requiring higher use of inotropes ( 0 vs . 4% , P < 001 ) , vasopressors ( 0 vs . 2% , P < 001 ) , and ventilatory support ( 7% vs . 9% , P = 01 ) . Cardiac treatments were used less frequently in children , and corticosteroids ( 3 vs , 3 , P < 001 ) and immunomodulators ( 1 vs . 5% , P < 001 ) were more common . MRE occurrence was substantial but not significantly different between children and adults ( 1 vs . 4% , P = 09 ) . Extra cardiac manifestations at admission were significant predictors of MRE [adjusted odds ratio 40 ( 43 38 ) ] , regardless of MIS status . CONCLUSIONS : AM exhibits variations in presentation , aetiologies and management but has a comparable 30 day prognosis in children and adults . These findings underscore the importance of tailored management strategies in AM across different age groups .
Glut1 Deficiency Syndrome ( Glut1DS ) has emerged as a treatable , but complex entity . Increasing data on pathogenic mechanisms , phenotype , genotype , and ketogenic dietary therapies ( KDT ) are available , as summarized in this review . Many challenges remain : novel symptoms emerge and vary with age . In Glut1DS , KDT in pregnancy and the clinical features in neonates and adults are poorly understood . KDT are ineffective in some patients for reasons yet unknown . Research reaches beyond the concept of brain energy depletion by impaired GLUT1 mediated glucose transfer across the blood brain barrier . Novel concepts investigate alternative substrates , transport mechanisms , and metabolic interactions of different brain cell types . Future , yet currently unavailable prospects are neonatal screening for Glut1DS , reliable biomarkers , predictors for outcome , and alternative therapies , along with and beyond KDT .
BACKGROUND : ZNF384 is a C2H2 type zinc finger protein ( ZNF ) which is implicated in DNA double strand break ( DSB ) repair through the classical non homologous end joining ( cNHEJ ) pathway . AIMS : To clarify the regulatory mechanisms involving ZNF384 in colon adenocarcinoma ( COAD ) . METHODS AND RESULTS : First , we conducted a differential expression gene ( DEG ) analysis of mRNA and lncRNA using TCGA COAD RNA Seq data . We also identified ZNF384 related mRNAs through Pearson ' s correlation coefficient calculation and conducted weighted gene co expression network analysis ( WGCNA ) for these genes , leading to the identification of a cluster of 331 genes with strongly positive correlation to tumor , 84 of which overlapped with DEGs . Gene functional analysis showed enrichment of genes in DNA repair , replication fork , and cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways . Protein protein interaction ( PPI ) network analysis of these 84 genes led to the identification of the top 20 key mRNAs . Then we employed three machine learning methods to refine our selection of candidate genes from these intersecting mRNAs . We constructed a competitive endogenous RNA ( ceRNA ) network and identified two significant intersecting miRNAs , miR 20b 5p and miR 424 5p , which have been shown to act as a tumor suppressor gene and an oncogene , respectively . Additionally , we found that KIF14 and KIF18B are regulated by these two miRNAs in this ceRNA network , particularly in DNA damage repair and cell cycle . Finally , validation using an external dataset from the GEO database confirmed their expression patterns . CONCLUSION : The current study clarifies the mechanisms of how miR 20b 5p and miR 424 5p work in colon cancer and underscores their predictive capabilities in colon cancer .
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the blood vessels caused by elevated levels of lipoproteins . The hyperlipoproteinemia triggers a series of cellular changes , particularly the activation of the macrophages , which play a crucial role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis . The presence of free cholesterol ( FC ) in lipoproteins may contribute to macrophage stimulation . However , the mechanisms linking the accumulation of FC in macrophages to their pro inflammatory activation remain poorly understood . Our research found a positive correlation between the number of pro inflammatory macrophages ( CD14 + CD16 + CD36 ( high ) ) in visceral adipose tissue and the levels of LDL C and cholesterol remnant particles in 56 healthy people . In contrast , the proportion of anti inflammatory , alternatively activated macrophages ( CD14 + CD16 CD163+ ) correlated negatively with HDL C . Additionally , our in vitro study demonstrated that macrophages accumulating FC promoted a pro inflammatory response , activating the TNF alpha and chemokine CCL3 genes . Furthermore , the accumulation of FC in macrophages alters the surface receptors on macrophages ( CD206 and CD16 ) and increases cellular granularity . Notably , the CD36 surface receptor and the ACAT and CD36 genes did not show a response . These results suggest a link between excessive FC accumulation and systemic inflammation to underlie the development of atherosclerosis .
Genetic variation in the 9p3 chromosomal region has one of the strongest associations known for coronary artery disease ( CAD ) that often leads to myocardial infarction ( MI ) . This risk locus encodes a long noncoding RNA , ANRIL , which has been suggested to regulate the neighboring cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors 2A and B ( Cdkn2A/B ) , the key regulators of cell proliferation . In this study , we aimed to clarify the role of the 9p3 risk locus in acute and chronic myocardial ischemia in mice . Mice carrying a deletion equivalent to the human CAD risk interval ( Chr4 ( Delta70kb/Delta70kb ) ) and wild type mice were exposed to MI and followed until 5 days or 4 weeks . In the wild type mice , expression of a lncRNA , Ak148321 , was increased after MI , and Cdkn2a was upregulated in chronic ischemia . Chr4 ( Delta70kb/Delta70kb ) downregulated both Cdkn2a/b , but this did not affect the survival or cardiac pathology after MI . These results suggest that the 9p3 locus is activated in response to cardiac ischemia . However , deficiency in the risk locus does not play a role in the cardiac pathophysiology in mice , supporting the studies suggesting the risk locus being more involved in the development of CAD , rather than the subsequent MI .
Transgender and gender non conforming ( TGNC ) individuals face significant health disparities despite growing visibility and awareness . Nutrition related disparities are particularly concerning , with TGNC individuals experiencing higher rates of food insecurity , eating disorders , body dissatisfaction , and overweight or obesity . Gender affirming hormone therapy ( GAHT ) and other medical interventions lead to significant physiological changes that can influence nutritional needs , as well as body composition and bone mineral density , yet existing daily energy estimation equations do not account for TGNC individuals or those undergoing GAHT . Perioperative nutrition is also vital , as gender affirming surgeries increase metabolic demands and risk of muscle loss due to immobility and catabolism . Moreover , TGNC individuals report higher rates of food insecurity , with transgender men being particularly affected , largely due to economic disparities and systemic discrimination . Eating disorders are likely under reported in this population due to limited access to competent , inclusive care . Most research combines transgender and gender non conforming individuals , limiting insight into subgroup differences . To improve health outcomes among TGNC individuals , there is a critical need for more inclusive , longitudinal research , particularly in the areas of nutrition , metabolism , and post surgical care . Such research could inform the development of tailored interventions , enhance healthcare provider competence , and support the creation of clinical guidelines that address the specific health and nutrition needs of TGNC individuals . Ultimately , this would help reduce disparities and promote long term well being for TGNC individuals . FAU Dissen , Anthony
Obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) leading to chronic intermittent hypoxia ( CIH ) is a common comorbidity associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) , a progressive fatal disease characterized by adverse lung remodeling and parenchymal stiffening . In the mouse model of lung fibrosis induced by intra tracheal instillation ( ITI ) of bleomycin , we have previously shown that CIH exacerbates fibrosis , similar to pre exposure to ITI . It has been suggested that correction of OSA and CIH with positive airway pressure may have a beneficial effect on the progression of fibrosis in IPF patients . Therefore , we designed this study to determine the benefits of stopping CIH in mice pre exposed to CIH for 3 weeks prior to bleomycin ITI . Interruption of CIH exposure was associated with less diffuse lung fibrosis , reduced ratio of damaged area , alveolar destruction , collagen deposition , and fibrosis score . Interruption of CIH exposure significantly reduced macrophage density in fibrotic areas without significant changes in either lymphocyte or neutrophil density . In conclusion , this study demonstrates that early treatment of OSA associated CIH can limit or reduce the development of severe forms of pulmonary fibrosis associated with a reduction in macrophage infiltrate and supports the beneficial effect of CIH exposure interruption on ongoing fibrosis severity .
This study investigated the multifunctional oral cavity simulator ( MOCS ) in terms of microbial composition , functional profile , and dentin root demineralization . Microcosm biofilms were grown on dentin using human saliva for 4 , 7 , and 14 days , with exposure to sucrose and a mucin enriched medium . Biofilms were analyzed for microbial viability and composition through CFU count and 16S rRNA gene sequencing . Demineralization was quantified by percentage surface hardness change ( %SHC ) , mineral loss ( ML ) , and lesion depth ( LD ) . The results showed microbial viability at all time points . After 7 days , aciduric/acidogenic and proteolytic organisms increased in abundance . The functional profile reflected the oscillations in microbial composition . No significant differences in %SHC , ML , or LD were observed across the time points . Carious lesions exhibited 60 70% SHC and 125 200 microm depth . MOCS was able to induce root carious lesions as result of microcosm biofilm metabolic activity , indicating its potential use in preclinical studies on root dentin caries . FAU Maske , Tamires Timm
The recognition of endogenous peptides by HLA class I plays a crucial role in CD8+ T cell immune responses and human adaptive cell immune . Thus , the prediction of HLA class I peptide binding affinities is always the core issue for the research of immune recognition and vaccine development . In this study , an evolutionary scale model ( ESM ) combined with parallel CNN blocks and a cross attention mechanism was used to construct a novel ESMpHLA model for predicting HLA class I binding peptides . Based on the 91 , 560 binding peptides of 41 HLA A alleles , 56 , 731 of 50 HLA B alleles and 2444 of 10 HLA C alleles , the ESMpHLA model was successfully established and achieved satisfying prediction performances with the overall accuracy and AUC values of 874 and 938 for the test dataset . The results indicate that the ESMpHLA model performs well in dealing with different HLA class I 2 field alleles as well as the peptides with different lengths . Then , the generalisation ability of the ESMpHLA model was validated by an independent test dataset compiled from recent IEDB weekly benchmark datasets . The results showed that the ESMpHLA model achieved the highest ROC AUC and PR AUC values when compared with the latest BVMHC , CapsNet MHC , STMHCpan and BVLSTM models . In addition , two ensemble models were also established by integrating the above 5 deep learning models using soft voting and hard voting strategies .
Spectral reflectance indices ( SRIs ) are increasingly recognized as valuable tools in wheat breeding programs for assessing traits that typically require destructive measurements . Little is known about the application of non descriptive methods in synthetic wheat and the effect of phenological stage . This study assessed variation and genetic parameters of SRIs and physiological parameters in a panel of synthetic wheat under both control and salinity conditions as well as the efficacy of SIR indices for selection across different phenological stages . Results indicated that salinity stress significantly reduced grain yield and relative water content while increasing ascorbate peroxidase ( APX ) enzyme activity across all growth stages . APX , peroxidase ( POD ) , and the Green Difference Vegetation Index ( GDVI ) showed the highest heritability and genotypic coefficient of variation ( GCV ) across all phenological stages , suggesting strong genetic control over these indices . The Normalized Difference Vegetative Index ( RNDVI ) also demonstrated a similar trend under control conditions across all phenological stages . Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) indicated that assessing SRIs concerning grain yield and physiological parameters was more effective during the anthesis and maturity stages than at milking . However , PCA effectively identified high yielding and salt tolerant genotypes during the milking stage , particularly at maturity . Overall , the SRIs analysis in wheat genotypes highlights their potential for optimizing selection timing and improving precision in breeding programs .
BACKGROUND : V set and immunoglobulin domain containing 4 ( VSIG4 ) is a B7 family related protein almost exclusively expressed on macrophages . The difference in its expression mediates the dynamic transformation of the polarization state of macrophages , but the underlying mechanism is still unclear . We sought to reveal the correlation between VSIG4 and the polarization of tumour associated macrophages ( TAMs ) and the immune escape of tumour cells in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . METHODS : THP 1 monocyte derived macrophages expressing different levels of VSIG4 were used for in vitro investigations . In addition , the co culture system was used to verify the effect of tumour cells on the expression of VSIG4 in macrophages , and the effect of VSIG4 expression level on tumour cells in turn . Subcutaneous xenograft models evaluated the tumour growth inhibition efficacy of VSIG4 blockade as monotherapy and combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) . RESULTS : CRC cells secreted lactate to promote VSIG4 expression in macrophages . On the contrary , VSIG4 promoted macrophage M2 polarization and induced malignant progression of tumour cells by promoting M2 macrophage secretion of heparin bound epidermal growth factor . In vivo experiments confirmed that knockdown VSIG4 inhibited tumour growth and improved the efficacy of ICIs therapy . Mechanistically , lactate secreted by CRC cells promoted its expression by influencing the epigenetic modification of VSIG4 in macrophages . In addition , VSIG4 enhanced the fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) of macrophages and upregulated PPAR gamma expression by activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway , which ultimately induced M2 polarization of macrophages . Downregulation of VSIG4 or blocking of FAO reversed the M2 polarization process of macrophages . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings provide a molecular basis for VSIG4 to influence TAMs polarization by regulating the reprogramming of FAO , suggesting that targeting VSIG4 in macrophages could enhance the ICIs efficacy and represent a new combination therapy strategy for immunotherapy of CRC . KEY POINTS : Colorectal cancer cells secrete lactate to upregulate VSIG4 in macrophages via the H3K18la METTL14 m6A axis . VSIG4 promotes fatty acid oxidation of macrophages and drives its M2 type polarization . These VSIG4 expressing M2 macrophages promote tumour progression and an immunosuppressive microenvironment . Inhibition of VSIG4 expression can synergistically enhance the therapeutic effect of anti PD 1 antibody .
BACKGROUND : This systematic review and meta analysis compared the differential effects of resistance training ( RT ) , aerobic training ( AT ) , and concurrent training ( CT ) on body mass and body fat loss in metabolically healthy individuals . METHODS : A systematic search of PubMed , SportDiscus , and Web of Science databases for randomized controlled trials published between January 1980 and January 2023 , comparing RT , AT , and CT in healthy adults was conducted . Primary outcomes of interest included changes in fat mass and body fat percentage ; secondary outcomes were body mass and fat free mass ( FFM ) . Sub analyses on intervention duration ( < or >/= 10 weeks ) , CT timing ( aerobic and resistance exercises done on the same day versus different days within a week ) , and workload matching ( equating workloads between AT , RT , and CT ) , were conducted . Study protocols followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines and were pre registered on PROSPERO ( CRD42023396530 ) . RESULTS : In total , 36 studies with 1564 participants were included in the systematic review , with only 31 studies included in the meta analysis due to missing data . For studies lasting at least 10 weeks , AT outperformed RT in reducing body mass ( mean difference ( MD ) = 82 kg [95% CI = 72 to 93] ; p < 001 ) and fat mass ( MD = 06 kg [95% CI = 88 to 24] ; p = 01 ) but led to less FFM retention ( MD = 88 kg [95% CI = 73 to 03] , p = 04 ) . CT reduced significantly more fat mass compared to RT ( MD : 09 kg [95% CI = 27 to 91] ; p = 009 ) . No significant differences were found between CT , AT , and RT in altering body fat percentage ( p > 05 ) . For studies shorter than 10 weeks , no significant differences were noted across exercise modalities ( p > 05 ) . Under conditions where AT , RT , and CT workloads were matched , similar fat mass , body mass , body fat percentage , and FFM changes were observed between exercise modalities ( p > 05 ) . Similar body mass and body fat percentage loss was observed between same day and different day CT ( p > 05 ) ; body fat mass loss only differed in a single study ( n = 1 ) when comparing RT to different day CT ( aerobic and resistance exercises done on different days within a week ) . CONCLUSIONS : While there are no differences in percent body fat loss between exercise modes , AT and CT are more effective than RT alone in reducing absolute fat mass ; however , RT neither improved nor impeded fat mass loss when incorporated into CT . Combining aerobic and resistance exercises on the same day or different day does not appear to influence the effectiveness of CT . When exercise interventions are short in duration ( <10 weeks ) , there does not appear to be a difference in fat loss between exercise modalities . These results support the concurrent use of aerobic and resistance exercises for fat mass reduction , as well as an emphasis on workload and duration when programming exercise for fat loss .

The Kinesin Eg5 motor protein is essential for the formation of the mitotic spindles and chromosome segregation , which is necessary for cell division . The inhibition of Eg5 has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for inhibiting the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells . This study aims to identify inhibitors targeting the allosteric site I of Eg To this end , a hierarchical virtual screening was applied to screen the ZINC20 Anodyne compound library comprising approximately 11 million druglike compounds . The procedure includes a shape similarity screening , a pharmacophore screening , docking studies with subsequent re scorings , molecular dynamics simulations , and Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area ( MM GBSA ) binding free energy calculations and resulted in the selection of four compounds for Eg5 inhibition assays . One compound displays an IC value of 29 microM , while the remaining three compounds show weaker inhibition of Kinesin Eg As such , structurally novel Kinesin Eg5 inhibitors have been obtained for further hit to lead optimization programs .
Plastics have revolutionized modern life , yet their persistence in the environment poses a growing ecological threat . Biodegradable plastics , like polycaprolactone ( PCL ) , offer a promising alternative , but their degradation can release toxic byproducts . In this study , we evaluated the ecotoxicological impact of 1 ethyl 3 ( 3 dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide ( EDC ) , a carbodiimide based additive used to stabilize PCL , using Daphnia magna as a model organism . Chronic toxicity assays revealed that EDC exposure at concentrations as low as 1 mg/L significantly impaired reproduction , and concentrations above 5 mg/L caused complete lethality . To clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms , RNA seq analysis was conducted using four developmental stages . Surprisingly , the highest number of differentially expressed genes appeared at Day 2 , prior to visible phenotypic changes . Gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed that EDC exposure induced endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress , indicated by suppressed ribosomal gene expression and enhanced protein folding and degradation pathways . Concurrently , sphingolipid metabolism and glutathione metabolism were altered , suggesting adaptive responses to maintain cellular homeostasis . These findings suggest that EDC leaching from degrading plastics can cause profound cellular and organismal toxicity , even at environmentally relevant concentrations . Our study highlights the need to assess the toxicity of not only intact polymers , but also their degradation byproducts , offering essential insights for safer plastic chemistry and for environmental risk evaluation .
BACKGROUND OBJECTIVES : Obesity is an increasing global public health problem with severe correlated chronic diseases ( physical and mental disorders ) . The aim of this study is to identify nutrient patterns among young adults who are overweight or obese based on their dietary intake , and to explore the associations between nutrient patterns and sociodemographic and clinical variables ( anthropometric , cardiometabolic , and psychological ) . METHODS : A voluntary response ( non random ) sample involving N = 188 overweight and obese university students ( men and women , with a mean age of 8 years [SD = 6] ) was recruited . Pregnancy , endocrine genetic disorders , weight loss diet and use of treatments that could affect endocrine parameters were defined as exclusion criteria . RESULTS : Three nutritional patterns were identified , that explained 69% of the total variance : ( a ) NP1 , characterised by a high intake of minerals and vitamins ; ( b ) NP2 , characterised by a high intake of carbohydrates ; and ( c ) NP3 , characterised by a high intake of fats and sodium . Higher mean scores in NP1 were related to female gender ( p = 015 ) , while higher NP1 and NP2 levels were associated to divorced/separated marital status ( p = 007 and p = 041 , respectively ) . Path analysis revealed a direct relationship between being within metabolically unhealthy obesity ( MUO ) levels and higher levels of anxiety ( standardised coefficient St . Coeff = 14 , p = 049 ) , depression ( St . Coeff = 17 , p = 014 ) and stress ( St . Coeff = 13 , p = 048 ) . In addition , the metabolic risk profile ( the classification into MUO vs . MHO ) achieved a mediational link between the factor scores for NP1 and a worse psychological state . DISCUSSION : This study provides empirical knowledge to design more effective prevention and treatment plans for young adults who are overweight or obese , considering the impact nutritional patterns have on metabolic and psychopathological distress .
Evernic acid ( EA ) has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent with its low toxicity and anticancer properties . In this study , the anticancer effect of EA on ovarian cancer cell lines and normal ovarian surface epithelial cells ( OSE ) was evaluated . The antiproliferative effect of EA was evaluated by xCELLigence Real Time Cell analysis , colony formation assay , and acridine orange and DAPI staining methods . Genotoxicity analysis was performed by comet assay . The effect of EA on cell migration was analyzed by wound healing assay . The potential of EA to induce apoptosis was also determined by evaluating the changes in gene and protein expression levels by qRT PCR and Western blot analysis , respectively . EA was found to be a promising potential therapeutic agent for ovarian cancer without showing significant cytotoxic effect on normal cells . Furthermore , EA decreased the ability of ovarian cancer cells for migration , increased the rate of apoptosis by inhibiting BIRC5 and activating CASP3 , triggered cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase , and caused a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and genotoxic effects . The results have shown that EA could be an effective candidate molecule for ovarian cancer treatment .
To link IFNgamma secretion levels of epitope specific T cells with their TCRalphabeta , we coated nanovials with pHLA I to capture and activate epitope specific T cells and their secreted IFNgamma , followed by index sorting and TCRalphabeta sequencing . We demonstrate that nanovials are a promising tool to link single epitope specific TCRalphabeta clonotypes to the cell ' s functional properties .
Upon antigen recognition , T cells undergo rapid cell proliferation and differentiation , which is accompanied by a drastic change in cellular metabolism . The ADP ribosylation factor ( Arf ) pathway contributes to cellular homeostasis by orchestrating vesicle trafficking , and our previous study using mice lacking both Arf1 and Arf6 ( Arf KO ) revealed that Th17 mediated autoimmune diseases were markedly suppressed in Arf KO mice though its precise mechanism remained elusive . Here , we show that Arf pathway modulates cellular metabolism in T cell activation and survival . We found that the lack of Arf1 and Arf6 resulted in hyper activation of mTORC1 , a master regulator of cellular metabolism , as well as unresolved endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress , leading to exaggerated apoptosis during T cell activation . We further demonstrated that treatment with IL 21 , a potent inducer of Tfh differentiation , rescued Arf KO T cells from apoptosis by attenuating ER stress in vitro . Accordingly , antigen specific antibody production and host defenses against infections such as Leishmania major or Heligmosomoides polygyrus infections were significantly preserved in Arf KO mice . Taken together , these findings provide mechanistic insights linking the Arf pathway with T cells homeostasis during activation and identify the Arf pathway as an ideal therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases with a low risk of opportunistic infections .
OBJECTIVES : This study investigated the relationship between metabolic factors ( blood lipids and glucose ) and inflammatory indicators ( tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF alpha] and high sensitivity C reactive protein [hs CRP] ) , disease activity , and the rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) risk . METHODS : Serum fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) and lipid profiles including total cholesterol ( Chol ) , triglycerides ( TG ) , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , and low density lipoprotein were measured in 100 RA patients and 100 healthy individuals . Disease severity was assessed using the disease activity score Inflammatory indicators ( TNF alpha and hs CRP ) were measured using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay method . RESULTS : In RA patients , serum FBG , TG , Chol/HDL , and TG/HDL were significantly elevated , whereas HDL levels reduced compared to healthy individuals . Multivariate analysis indicated that each unit increase in serum FBG , HDL , Chol/HDL , and TG/HDL was associated with a 64% increase ( p<001 ) , a 7% reduction ( p=001 ) , a 52% increase ( p=007 ) , and a 54% increase ( p=001 ) in the odds of RA , respectively . Disease activity showed no correlation with metabolic factors ( p>05 ) . Among all metabolic factors studied , FBG had the largest area under the curve ( 981 ) ( p<0001 ) for predicting RA . Across the total participant group , FBG , TG , and TG/HDL were positively associated with hs CRP and TNF alpha ( p<05 ) . HDL showed an inverse association with hs CRP ( p=008 ) . Among RA patients specifically , TNF alpha positively correlated with TG and TG/HDL , while hs CRP correlated only with TG/HDL . CONCLUSION : These findings indicate that increased FBG and Chol/HDL and decreased HDL may elevate RA risk by promoting systemic inflammation . Among these , elevated FBG may serve as the strongest predictor of RA risk . FAU Kheirouri , Sorayya
BACKGROUND Midazolam , a commonly used sedative , faces challenges in cancer therapy due to its central nervous system ( CNS ) toxicity and suboptimal targeting of tumor sites . This study explores the use of poly ( lactic co glycolic acid ) ( PLGA ) nanoparticles to enhance the delivery of Midazolam , aiming to improve antitumor efficacy while minimizing CNS toxicity . MATERIAL AND METHODS We developed Midazolam loaded PLGA nanoparticles ( Midazolam PLGA NPs ) using the ultrasonic emulsification solvent evaporation technique . These nanoparticles were thoroughly characterized for particle size , polydispersity index ( PDI ) , zeta potential , encapsulation efficiency , drug loading , and stability . We assessed cellular uptake and cytotoxicity via the MTT assay , while organ accumulation was quantified using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( HPLC MS ) . The safety profile was evaluated by monitoring body weight changes in A549 tumor bearing mice . RESULTS The Midazolam PLGA nanoparticles exhibited a spherical shape , uniform size , high encapsulation efficiency , and excellent colloidal stability . In vitro release studies indicated that 51% of Midazolam was released within 24 hours . Enhanced cellular uptake was noted for the nanoparticles in comparison to the solution , with significant accumulation at tumor sites and increased free drug release . The nanoparticles effectively killed tumor cells while sparing normal tissues , demonstrating superior antitumor activity compared to the Midazolam solution . Importantly , treated mice maintained stable body weight , suggesting a favorable safety profile . CONCLUSIONS Midazolam loaded PLGA nanoparticles present a promising approach for targeted cancer therapy . They enhance encapsulation , stability , and selective tumor cell cytotoxicity , resulting in greater antitumor efficacy with minimal adverse effects compared to conventional Midazolam solutions .

Neural stem/progenitor cells ( NSPCs ) operate in specialized niches of the adult mammalian brain , where their proliferative and differentiative potential is modulated by a myriad of factors . Emerging evidence sheds light on the interaction between cannabinoids and neurotrophic factors underlying a major regulatory force of NSPC dynamics . Previous data show that cannabinoid type 2 receptors ( CB2Rs ) tightly regulate the actions of brain derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , a neurotrophic factor highly upregulated during physical exercise . However , further research into the effects of exercise associated neurotrophic factors in the regulation of NSPCs is still necessary . Therefore , we aimed at exploring the effects of exercise associated factors in postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis and how CB2Rs regulate this process . By using dentate gyrus derived neurospheres and treating them with a combination of exercise associated factors , as an in vitro proxy for exercise , we found that these factors significantly promoted cell proliferation , an action partially reduced when CB2Rs were blocked . Moreover , CB2Rs were shown to be required for the actions of this exercise mimicking cocktail in early neuronal commitment and differentiation . However , late neuronal differentiation promoted by exercise associated factors remained unaltered in the presence of CB2R ligands . Together , these data suggest that CB2R actions are preponderant in early stages of hippocampal neurogenesis promoted by exercise . Astroglial late differentiation was also accelerated by a combination of exercise associated factors , an effect prevented by CB2R blockage . This work provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the actions of cannabinoids and exercise on NSPC regulation , highlighting the role of CB2R in modulating exercise induced hippocampal neurogenesis .
Cell lines that produce non originator versions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) monoclonal antibody reference material 8671 ( NISTmAb ) are invaluable to the biopharmaceutical industry because , unlike typical commercial cell lines , they can be used on a collaborative and noncompetitive basis for bioprocess development . NIST has generated NS0 clones , NISTCHO research grade test material 10197 and reference material 8675 NISTCHO to fill this need . We set out to optimize seed train procedures , media and feeding strategies , and stirred tank and rocking bioreactor processes to facilitate our studies on the effects of cell substrate and bioreactor process parameters on non originator NISTmAb quality attributes . For two NS0 clones and NISTCHO , we improved the baseline methods for seed train culture and demonstrated the critical roles of agitation and gassing strategies for stirred tank bioreactor operations . For NISTCHO we also tested fed batch and perfusion processes in rocking bioreactors , identifying several critical process parameters and in process controls . In this work , for the NIST NS0 59 and NS0 66 clones , we demonstrated that shake flask geometry was critical for culturing a highly viable seed train with a high growth rate and exhibited impacts of feeds , agitation , and gassing during initial bioreactor process development . We identified agitation rates and gassing strategy as critical process parameters for NISTCHO stirred tank bioreactor operations and established processes for fed batch and perfusion rocking bioreactor operations . We anticipate this work to benefit the growing number of researchers employing non originator NISTmAb expressing cell lines to support precompetitive innovation in biomanufacturing .

OBJECTIVES : This study aimed to investigate the impact of supplementing the maternal cafeteria diet with omega 3 fatty acids ( omega3 ) on serum glucose , insulin , and leptin levels , as well as hypothalamic mRNA expression levels of pro opiomelanocortin ( Pomc ) , neuropeptide Y ( Npy ) , agouti related protein ( Agrp ) , and brain derived neurotrophic factor ( Bdnf ) genes in the offspring . METHODS : Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( n = 8 each ) : cafeteria diet , cafeteria diet plus omega3 supplementation ( 300 mg/kg/day ) , chow diet , and chow diet plus omega3 supplementation . Gestation and lactation were monitored , and blood and tissue samples were collected from 62 offspring . RESULTS : No significant differences were observed in maternal body weight at pregnancy onset . However , dietary intervention influenced weight gain and intake during gestation and lactation . The cafeteria diet group consumed more energy , fat , saturated fat , and less protein and fiber , with similar carbohydrate intake . This group showed higher serum glucose levels in offspring than the control group , while insulin and leptin levels remained unaffected . Supplementing the maternal cafeteria diet with omega3 had no beneficial effect on serum glucose , insulin , or leptin . Neither the cafeteria diet nor omega3 supplementation altered hypothalamic Pomc , Npy , Agrp , or Bdnf mRNA expression . DISCUSSION : These findings suggest that the maternal cafeteria diet may adversely affect some biochemical parameters in offspring without inducing short term changes in nutrition related gene expression . Omega3 supplementation conferred no apparent therapeutic benefit . Limitations include the absence of adiposity measurements and long term follow up , which may have influenced outcomes . Further research is needed to explore long term metabolic consequences and underlying epigenetic mechanisms . FAU Koc , Aslihan
We investigated the influence of CYP2B6 , GSTP1 , and SLCO1B1 star allele predicted phenotypes and CBR1 variants on clinical outcomes in patients with HCC receiving DOX via TACE . A prospective cohort of patients with HCC underwent DOX therapy via TACE . Selected genes were genotyped in germline DNA samples from the final cohort ( 82 patients ) via Axiom Precision Medicine Diversity ( PMD ) Research Array technology . The Kaplan Meier ( KM ) method and Cox proportional hazards ( CPH ) model were employed to find independent clinical and genetic predictors of overall survival ( OS ) and progression free survival ( PFS ) after TACE . Based on univariate and combined association analyses of genetic factors , the star alleles predicting the phenotypic status of three genes ( CYP2B6 , GSTP1 , and SLCO1B1 ) did not significantly modify the response potential of DOX via TACE , as indicated by OS or PFS . Conversely , we found a novel association between two CBR1 polymorphisms ( rs3787728 and rs1005695 ) and interindividual differences in OS and PFS . The presence of a heterozygous genotype ( TC or CG at either locus , which were highly frequent in our cohort ) , probably with greater CBR metabolic activity , appeared to have an expressive influence by negatively modulating the consequences of DOX locoregional therapy on HCC by shortening the median OS ( KM p = 02 and 04 , respectively ) and median PFS ( KM p = 05 and 023 , respectively ) in comparison to those with other haplotypes . Exploratory PGx studies involving a wider HCC cohort and targeting more DOX related genes are needed to replicate our findings .

Pathogens frequently produce proteins to evade or inhibit host immune responses . One such protein is lymphostatin from attaching and effacing Escherichia coli ( also known as lymphocyte inhibitory factor A ; LifA ) , which influences intestinal colonization and inhibits mitogen and antigen activated proliferation of T lymphocytes and pro inflammatory cytokine synthesis . Here , we report the cloning , purification and characterization of a LifA homologue from Chlamydia pecorum . The predicted 382 KDa protein ( CPE2_0552 ) exhibited 36% identity and 55% similarity over 3171 amino acids to lymphostatin from enteropathogenic E . coli strain E2348/ CPE2_0552 shares glycosyltransferase and cysteine protease motifs required for lymphostatin activity , including similarity in the tertiary structure of these domains predicted by AlphaFold Purified CPE2_0552 did not share the L shaped globular structure of lymphostatin when analyzed by transmission electron microscopy . CPE2_0552 inhibited concanavalin A stimulated proliferation of bovine T cells in a concentration dependent manner , with an inhibitory dose 50 ( ID ) of 812 pg/mL . This was 38 fold higher than the ID of E . coli E2348/69 lymphostatin tested in parallel on T cells from the same donors ( 21 pg/mL ) , but was similar to another LifA homologue from E . coli O157 : H7 ( ToxB ) . Moreover , CPE2_0552 inhibited the secretion of interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) , a key cytokine that influences the outcome of Chlamydia infections . At the concentrations at which CPE2_0552 inhibited T lymphocyte proliferation and IFNgamma secretion , negligible cytotoxicity was observed after 72 h of stimulation . Our study indicates that E . coli lymphostatin belongs to a wider family of lymphocyte inhibitory molecules that exist in distantly related bacterial pathogens . FAU Blackburn , Elizabeth A
Approximately 60 million individuals worldwide are currently living with dementia . As the median age of the world ' s population rises , the number of dementia cases is expected to increase markedly , and to affect approximately 150 million individuals by This will create a huge and unsustainable economic and social burden across the globe . Although promising pharmacological treatment options for Alzheimer ' s disease the most common cause of dementia are starting to emerge , dementia prevention and risk reduction remain vital . In this review , we present evidence from large scale epidemiological studies and randomised controlled trials to indicate that adherence to healthy dietary patterns could improve cognitive function and lower dementia risk . We outline potential systemic ( e . g . improved cardiometabolic health , lower inflammation , modified gut microbiome composition/metabolism , slower pace of aging ) and brain specific ( e . g . lower amyloid beta load , reduced brain atrophy and preserved cerebral microstructure and energetics ) mechanisms of action . We also explore current gaps in our knowledge and outline potential directions for future research in this area . Our aim is to provide an update on current state of the knowledge , and to galvanise research on this important topic . FAU Shannon , Oliver M
This report details a rare pediatric case of hyperammonemic encephalopathy caused by the oral iron chelating drug deferasirox ( DFR ) in a septic patient . It is our contention that this study lends support to the existing literature , as it describes the case of a 15 year old female patient with a history of sickle cell disease who presented with a fever and vomiting , rapid development of sleepiness , consciousness disturbances , medium mydriasis , neck stiffness , and trismus with seizure . Her Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) score was Laboratory tests revealed an increase in creatinine , metabolic acidosis , hyperammonemia , high cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) glutamine levels , alterations in coagulation and in liver function , rising inflammatory markers , cerebral oedema on brain Computerized Tomography ( CT ) scan , 10 ; 6 copies/ml of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA ) in pulmonary swab film array , and elevated DFR blood level . The treatment plan involved the early cessation of DFR , the correction of acidosis , mechanical ventilation , mannitol and bioarginine , vasoactive drug , antibiotics , and supportive care with continuous veno venous hemodiafiltration ( CVVHDF ) for hyperammonemia and therapeutic plasma exchange ( TPE ) for a high CSF glutamine level resulting from cytotoxic encephalopathy . The patient successfully overcame the multiorgan failure , with no permanent neurologic complications . It is our opinion that healthcare providers and family caregivers of patients with chronic disease may be particularly attuned to the emergence of any sign or symptom , and thus well positioned to take prompt action to avert life threatening clinical deterioration due to rising DFR levels . It is recommended that critical care providers commence extracorporeal blood purification therapies ( EBPT ) at the earliest opportunity , taking care to adapt the technique to the specific needs of the patient and to avoid the potential for fatal neurological complications .
Freeze injury is typically quantified by measuring electrolyte leakage from plant tissues exposed to a freeze thaw cycle , whereby higher leakage indicates greater injury . The severity of stress is also assessed by the ability ( or lack thereof ) of the injured tissue to recover , wherein reduced leakage during the post thaw period relative to right after thaw indicates recoverable injury . In this study , spinach leaves were injured to various degrees by freezing them for different durations at a fixed sub zero temperature . We explored the cellular nature of freeze thaw injury by comparing the profiles of cellular metabolites that were leaked from reversibly and/or irreversibly injured leaves . A total of 47 metabolites were , thus , detected in the leachate , including 8 sugars , 20 amino acids , GABA , uracil , adenine , palmitic acid , ferulic , coumaric acid , and other organic/inorganic acids involved in primary and secondary metabolism ( e . g . , citric acid , phosphoric acid , coumaric acid , etc . ) . Combined multivariate metabolome analysis , including principal component analysis , hierarchical clustering , and partial least square discriminant analysis , together identified 14 key metabolites mainly responsible for distinguishing the reversible vs . irreversible injury . These metabolites are also indicators for various lesions , including structural/functional perturbations to cellular components ( cell wall , chloroplast , vacuole , plasma membrane , nucleic acids ) , disruption of metabolic homeostasis ( antioxidant system , cytoplasmic pH , Kreb ' s cycle ) , protein degradation , and hypoxia .
Sulfated flavonoids , prevalent in various plants , possess enhanced bioavailability due to the introduction of sulfonate groups , a process catalyzed by flavonoid sulfotransferases ( SULTs ) . These enzymes serve as invaluable tools for exploring the structure function relationships of sulfated flavonoids and for the preparation of biologically active derivatives . Despite their significance , flavonoid SULTs remain largely unexplored especially for those from marine environment . In this study , we report the discovery of CcrSULT1 , the first flavonoid SULT from the red algaChondrus crispus . Substrate specificity tests revealed that CcrSULT1 exhibits a pronounced chemical selectivity preference for phenolic compounds , particularly flavonoids . More importantly , we discovered that CcrSULT1 may have unique regional selectivity toward mono phenolic hydroxyl groups ( e . g . , the 4 ' OH of kaempferol , a flavonoid aglycone widely distributed in algae and various plants ) in substrates , potentially leading to the specific production of monosulfated products . This hypothesis is further supported by the construction of a complex structural model . This study paves the way for the discovery of unknown algal sulfotransferases and provides a biological basis for understanding algal sulfation metabolism and biomass conversion . FAU Chen , Wencui
Anemia of chronic disease ( ACD ) is the most frequent clinical issue in patients with chronic disease , ACD is usually secondary to chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , cancer , and chronic infection , which is associated with poor health outcomes , increased morbidity and mortality , and substantial economic costs . Current treatment options for ACD are very limited . The discovery of the hypoxia inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase ( HIF PHD ) pathway made it possible to develop novel therapeutic agents ( such as hypoxia inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor , HIF PHI ) to treat ACD by stabilizing HIF and subsequently promoting endogenous erythropoietin ( EPO ) production and iron absorption and utilization . Thus , HIF PHIs appear to open a new door for the treatment of ACD patients with a novel mechanism . Here , we comprehensively reviewed the latest advancements in the application of HIF PHIs in ACD . Specifically , we highlighted the key features of HIF PHIs on ACD , such as stimulation of endogenous EPO , handling iron metabolism , inflammation independent , and prolonging lifespan of red blood cells . In conclusion , the success of HIF PHIs in the treatment of ACD may expand the therapeutic opportunity for other types of anemia beyond renal anemia .
BACKGROUND : Major depressive disorder is one of the main causes of disability worldwide , but its etiopathology remains largely unknown , although several hypotheses have been proposed . Recent studies suggest a potential role for matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP 9 ) in depression , as it is overexpressed in the plasma of depressed patients and normalizes following chronic antidepressant treatment . This study aimed to characterize anxiety and depression like behaviors in transgenic MMP 9 mice , as well as the expression of different neuroplasticity markers associated with depression , in both sexes . METHODS : In this study , we characterized the behavioral phenotypes of both MMP 9 knockout and MMP 9 overexpressing male and female mice . Here , we used a battery of tests to assess anxiety ( open field , light‒dark box , elevated plus maze , and novelty‒suppressed feeding tests ) , depressive like ( tail suspension and social interaction tests ) , and cognitive ( T maze ) behaviors . RESULTS : MMP 9 knockout female mice displayed increased innate anxiety ( open field test ) , decreased behavioral despair ( tail suspension test ) . Compared with control mice , female MMP 9 knockout mice presented increased levels of different neuroplasticity markers in the hippocampus . With respect to MMP 9 overexpressing mice , females presented decreased innate anxiety ( elevated plus maze ) . Male MMP 9 overexpressing mice presented greater conflict based anxiety ( novelty suppressed feeding test ) than control mice did . CONCLUSIONS : MMP 9 activity modifies anxiety and depression like behaviors , as well as neuroplasticity markers , in female but not in male mice . These findings reinforce the sex differences in the etiopathology of depression .
BACKGROUND : Diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) is a progressive retinal disease that leads to vision loss if not detected early . Metabolomic analysis of vitreous humor offers a promising approach to identifying biomarkers associated with disease onset and progression . This pilot study investigates the metabolomic profiles of vitreous humor from patients at different stages of DR , aiming to uncover potential biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of disease progression . METHODS : Vitreous samples were collected during therapeutic pars plana vitrectomy of 23 patients without diabetes ( CTRL ) , with diabetes and without retinopathy ( DIA ) , non proliferative DR ( NPDR ) and proliferative DR ( PDR ) . Metabolomics was performed using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry . RESULTS : Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolic signatures differentiating the patient groups . Lysine , proline , and arginine levels progressively increased from DIA to NPDR and PDR stages , highlighting their association with disease progression . Methionine and threonine showed notable increases in PDR compared to all other groups , while carnitine , a key metabolite in lipid metabolism , exhibited stage specific increases , peaking in PDR . The detection of systemic and topical drugs , including metformin and tropicamide , in the vitreous further emphasizes altered ocular permeability in DR . CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest that metabolomic profiling could provide valuable insights into the underlying pathogenesis of DR and serve as a foundation for personalized therapeutic strategies .
OBJECTIVE : Micronutrients , such as vitamins and minerals , are essential for cardiac health , but their effects on cardiac structure and function remain unclear . This study aimed to investigate the causal impact of micronutrients on cardiac traits through Mendelian randomization ( MR ) . METHODS : A two sample MR approach was employed to assess the causal effects between 14 micronutrients and 98 cardiac traits from various consortia and cohorts . Inverse variance weighted ( IVW ) MR analyses were conducted , alongside a range of sensitivity analyses to confirm robustness . Both exposure and outcome populations were of European descent . RESULTS : Significant associations were found for Vitamins A1 , B9 , and D with various cardiac traits . Vitamin D was linked to reduced left ventricular end diastolic myocardial wall thickness ( IVW beta : 16 ; 95% CI : 29 to 03 ; p = 01 ) and increased regional longitudinal and radial strains of the left ventricle ( IVW beta : 19 ; p = 03 ; IVW beta : 17 ; p = 04 ) . Vitamin A1 was associated with reduced left ventricular mass ( IVW beta : 23 ; p = 03 ; IVW beta : 72 ; p = 007 ) , both with and without body surface area and blood pressure adjustments . Vitamin B9 was associated with reductions in left ventricular mass ( IVW beta : 09 ; p = 04 ) , myocardial wall thickness ( IVW beta : 13 ; p = 04 ) , and ascending aorta maximum area ( IVW beta : 19 ; p = 01 ) . No significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy was observed . CONCLUSIONS : Vitamins A1 , B9 , and D exhibit beneficial effects on cardiac structure and function , offering potential targets for nutritional intervention in at risk populations .
BACKGROUND : DNA 5 methylcytosine ( 5mC ) and RNA N6 methyladenosine ( m6A ) methylation are prevalent modifications in eukaryotes , both playing crucial roles in gene regulation . Recent studies have explored their crosstalk and impact on transcription . However , the intricate relationships among 5mC , m6A , and gene expression remain incompletely elucidated . RESULTS : We collect data on 5mC , m6A , and gene expression from samples from three tissues from each of four pregnant cattle and sheep . We construct a comprehensive genome wide self interaction ( same gene ) and across interaction ( across genes ) network of 5mC and m6A within gene bodies or promoters and gene expression in both species . Qualitative analysis identifies uniquely expressed genes with specific m6A methylation in each tissue from both species . A quantitative comparison of gene expression ratio between methylated and unmethylated genes for m6A within gene body and promoter , and 5mC within gene body and promoter confirms the positive effect of RNA methylation on gene expression . Importantly , the influence of RNA methylation on gene expression is stronger than that of DNA methylation . The predominant self and across interactions are between RNA methylation within gene bodies and gene expression , as well as between RNA methylation within promoters and gene expression in both species . CONCLUSIONS : RNA methylation has a stronger effect on gene expression than does DNA methylation within gene bodies and promoters . DNA and RNA methylation in gene bodies has a greater impact on gene expression than those in promoters . These findings deepen comprehension of the dynamics and complex relationships among the epigenome , epitranscriptome , and transcriptome , offering fresh insights for advancing epigenetics research .
BACKGROUND : The use of polygenic risk scores ( PRS ) for predicting disease risk in Japanese populations , particularly for dementia and related phenotypes , remains markedly unexplored . The aim of this study was to bridge this gap by developing a novel PRS model designed to predict amyloid beta ( Abeta ) deposition utilizing positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging data from a Japanese cohort . METHODS : Using the polygenic risk score continuous shrinkage ( PRS CS ) algorithm , we calculated PRS based on significant single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) associated with Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) in this population . We applied a PRS calculation approach informed by Japanese genome wide association studies ( GWAS ) summary statistics into a Japanese dementia cohort from Keio University . RESULTS : Our findings revealed that a p value threshold of pT < 1 optimally enhanced the predictive capability of the Japanese Abeta PET positivity risk model . Moreover , we demonstrated that distinguishing between the counts of APOE2 and APOE4 alleles in our calculations significantly elevated model performance , achieving an area under the curve ( AUC ) of Remarkably , this predictive accuracy remained robust even when the pT was adjusted to be < 0 x 10 ( 5 ) , maintaining an AUC of This study validated the efficacy of the model in identifying individuals with a increased risk of amyloid pathology . CONCLUSIONS : These findings highlight the potential of PRS as a noninvasive tool for early detection and risk stratification of AD , which could lead to enhanced clinical applications and interventions .
BACKGROUND : Methylation of RNA is involved in many pathophysiological processes . The roles of N6 methyladenosine ( m6A ) and N7 methylguanosine ( m7G ) in heart failure ( HF ) have been established . However , the impact of 5 methylcytosine ( m5C ) on HF and its relationship with the immune microenvironment ( IME ) remains elusive . METHODS : GSE141910 ( 200 HF , 166 NFDs ) was used as training cohort . Focusing on 9 identified m5C differently expressed genes ( DEGs ) , random forests ( RF ) , LASSO logistic regression , and SVM RFE were employed to identify hub genes . ROC curves were plotted to confirm the predictive value in diagnostic model . ScRNA seq revealed cell type specific m5C regulator expression patterns and HF IME . Hub genes were validated using HF rat models after myocardial infarction ( MI ) through quantitative reverse transcription PCR ( qRT PCR ) and western blot ( WB ) . Consensus clustering algorithms identified two m5C related HF subtypes . Single sample gene set enrichment analysis ( ssGSEA ) and CIBERSORT deconvolution algorithm analyzed the IME in HF . Finally , we employed WGCNA and PPI network to find m5C associated key genes and their clinical significance in HF subgroups . RESULTS : In HF samples , four m5C regulators ( NSUN6 , DNMT3A , DNMT3B and ALYREF ) were greatly upregulated , while five ( NOP2 , NSUN3 , NSUN7 , DNMT1 and TRDMT1 ) were downregulated compared to NFDs in the training set . ALYREF positively correlated with activated NK cells and monocytes , whereas TRDMT1 and NSUN3 showed inverse correlations with these cells . Four hub genes were identified by machine learning algorithms and all verified by validation model . Single cell RNA seq dataset GSE183852 examined the levels of 13 m5C regulators across 11 different cell types in HF . In vivo experiments including qRT PCR and WB finally identified NSUN6 as the most remarkable regulator . The diagnostic model demonstrated excellent performance in distinguishing between HF and NFDs ( AUC 869 , 95%CI 832 906 ) . The two m5C subtypes exhibited distinct modification patterns , immune cell infiltration , immune checkpoints , and HLA gene expression . Additionally , 138 differentially expressed genes were uncovered based on m5C subtypes , and GSEA revealed associations with key pathophysiological mechanisms of HF . By using WGCNA and PPI network , three m5C associated key genes ( RPS21 , RPL36 and RPS19 ) were identified significantly influencing cardiac function in clinical practice . CONCLUSION : HF diagnostic model is developed based on 4 robust m5C RNA modification biomarkers ( DNMT3B , NOP2 , NSUN6 and DNMT1 ) . Two distinct m5C RNA modification patterns in HF are identified , illustrating different IME characteristics . Our findings underline the significance of m5C regulators in HF , offering new perspectives on HF mechanisms and potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategies .
BACKGROUND : Mammography screening has improved early breast cancer detection , leading to reduced mortality and lower rates of advanced breast cancer . However , mammography has a high false positive rate that results in over a million invasive breast biopsies of benign lesions in the US each year . Therefore , there is a need for noninvasive , blood based diagnostics that can accurately assess risk of malignancy for women with indeterminate lesions identified by mammography , such as BI RADS category 4 breast lesions . The aim of this study is to identify biomarkers from multiplexed extracellular vesicle liquid biopsy that can accurately classify mammographically detected BI RADS 4 lesions . METHODS : We analyzed plasma from 113 prospectively enrolled subjects with BI RADS 4 breast lesions , including 86 women with benign lesions and 27 women with malignant lesions ( including 12 with stage I invasive carcinoma and 14 with ductal carcinoma in situ ) . None of the invasive carcinomas were metastatic . From each plasma sample , we used track etched magnetic nanopore technology to separately isolate HER2 and CD24 expressing extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) and measured their miRNA cargo using next generation sequencing . We evaluated the performance of EV miRNA biomarkers for classifying malignancy and applied LASSO classification to identify a panel of four complementary EV miRNA biomarkers that we validated by qPCR . RESULTS : We identified 19 differentially enriched miRNA from HER2+ EVs and 11 differentially enriched miRNA from CD24+ EVs of women with malignant lesions compared to benign lesions . We observed individual miRNA with an AUC of up to 87 for miR 340 5p from HER2+ EVs and 75 for miR 223 3p from CD24+ EVs . LASSO classification selected a panel of four complementary EV miRNA for classifying breast cancer : miR 340 5p ( HER2+ EVs ) , miR 598 3p ( CD24+ ) , miR 15b 5p ( HER2+ ) , and miR 126 3p ( CD24+ ) . CONCLUSIONS : HER2+ and CD24+ EV subpopulations contain complementary biomarkers suitable for validation in larger studies that can accurately detect early stage breast cancer among women with BI RADS category 4 breast lesions .
BACKGROUND : Genetic factors and an unfavorable intrauterine environment may contribute to the development of metabolic disorders in offspring later in life . The present study aims to investigate and compare the risks of pre diabetes mellitus ( pre DM ) , type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and abnormal glucose tolerance in female and male offspring with early maternal menopausal age versus those with normal maternal menopausal age , later in life . METHODS : In this prospective population based study , there were 1 , 516 females and 1 , 563 males with normal maternal menopausal age , as well as 213 females and 237 males with early maternal menopausal age . Unadjusted and adjusted cox regression models were used to assess the hazard ratios ( HRs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) for the association between early maternal menopausal age with pre DM , T2DM and abnormal glucose tolerance in offspring . Statistical analysis was performed using the STATA software package ; the significance level was set at P < RESULTS : The present study revealed a higher risk of pre DM in female offspring with early maternal menopausal age compared to females with normal maternal menopausal age ( unadjusted HR ( 95% CI ) : 42 ( 98 , 05 ) ; P = 06 ( marginal significant ) and adjusted HR ( 95% CI ) : 47 ( 00 , 16 ) ; P = 04 ) . Additionally , a higher risk of abnormal glucose tolerance among female offspring with early maternal menopausal age in adjusted model was observed ( HR ( 95% CI ) : 13 ( 99 29 ) ; P = 06 , marginal significant ) . However , no significant differences were observed in the risks of developing pre DM and abnormal glucose tolerance in male offspring with early maternal menopausal age compared to males with normal maternal menopausal age in both unadjusted and adjusted models . No significant difference was observed in the risk of T2DM in the offspring with early maternal menopausal age compared to offspring with normal maternal menopausal age . CONCLUSIONS : This pioneering study , characterized by a long term follow up , demonstrated that early maternal menopausal age is associated with an increased risk of developing pre DM in female offspring later in life . It may be advisable to implement screening for pre DM and glucose metabolism disorders in these female offspring . CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER : Not applicable .
BACKGROUND : Non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is a significant global health challenge , with 2% of cases fuelled by RET rearrangements . RET inhibitors ( RETi ) have revolutionized treatment for these patients , but resistance remains an important clinical challenge limiting therapy effectiveness . This study investigated the mechanisms underlying resistance to RETi . METHODS : NSCLC cells were exposed to increasing doses of RETi ( pralsetinib/BLU 667 and selpercatinib/LOXO 292 ) to generate resistant cells . RNA Sequencing analysis identified differentially expressed genes in resistant versus sensitive cells , followed by in vitro and in vivo functional assays to explore novel therapeutic strategies . Additionally , tumor biopsies from RET rearranged NSCLC patients who exhibited cancer progression on RET inhibitor therapy were analyzed . RESULTS : RNA sequencing analysis revealed the upregulation of the EGFR signaling pathway and hyperactivation of AP1 complex members in resistant cells compared to sensitive cells . Silencing of EGFR and AP1 complex members significantly reversed drug resistance , whereas EGFR overexpression reduced the sensitivity of parental Lc2/AD cells to RET inhibitors . Furthermore , the combination of RET and EGFR inhibitors showed synergistic antitumor activity in vitro and hindered tumor growth in mouse models with resistant cell xenografts . Notably , we observed a significant increase in EGFR expression in tumor biopsies from NSCLC patients treated with RET inhibitors who experienced disease progression , further validating the clinical relevance of our findings . CONCLUSIONS : This study elucidates EGFR ' s role in mediating resistance to RET inhibitors in NSCLC patients . These findings offer insights into therapeutic adaptation and explore personalized combinations of RET and EGFR inhibitors for improved clinical outcomes .
BACKGROUND : Interactions between the nasal epithelium , commensal nasal microbiota , and respiratory pathogens play a key role in respiratory infections . Currently , there is a lack of experimental models to study such interactions under defined in vitro conditions . Here , we developed a porcine nasal organoid ( PNO ) system from nasal tissue of pigs as well as from cytological brushes . RESULTS : PNOs exhibited similar structure and cell types to the nasal mucosa , as evaluated by immunostaining . PNOs were inoculated with porcine commensal strains of Moraxella pluranimalium , Rothia nasimurium , and the pathobiont Glaesserella parasuis for examining host commensal pathogen interactions . All strains adhered to the PNOs , although at different levels . M . pluranimalium and G . parasuis strains stimulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines , whereas R . nasimurium induced the production of IFNgamma and diminished the proinflammatory effect of the other strains . CONCLUSIONS : Overall , PNOs mimic the in vivo nasal mucosa and can be useful to perform host microbe interaction studies . Video Abstract .
BACKGROUND : Breast cancer neoadjuvant therapy may negatively impact the immune system . As a secondary outcome of the docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) for women with breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting ( DHA WIN trial ) , we sought to assess the effects of an intervention with DHA on parameters of immune function of women undergoing neoadjuvant therapy . METHODS : Women with early stage breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting were recruited for the DHA WIN trial and randomly assigned to receive either 4 g/day of DHA or a placebo for 18 weeks in conjunction with their neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer . Venous blood was collected to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells . Immune parameters were assessed by measuring white blood cell concentration , flow cytometry , and cytokines concentration after mitogen stimulated immune response . RESULTS : In the placebo group the proportion of T cells ( CD3 + ) , and functionally active monocytes ( CD14 + HLA DR + ) was reduced at the last cycle of chemotherapy ( 15 weeks ) but remained constant in the DHA group ( P interaction < 05 ) . The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) was maintained in the DHA group but increased in the placebo at the end of chemotherapy ( P interaction = 02 ) . An increase in this ratio was associated with lower chance of achieving pathological complete response ( OR = 32 , 95% CI [14 , 16] , P = 01 ) . After 15 weeks of therapy , the DHA supplemented group had higher concentrations of stimulated cytokines IL 4 , IL 10 , and the T helper type 1 cytokine IFN gamma after phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) challenge , and higher concentrations of TNF alpha and IFN gamma cytokines after lipopolysaccharide exposure ( P < 05 ) . CONCLUSION : Supplementing DHA during breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy improved systemic immune function by attenuating changes in blood cell concentrations , preventing depletion of immune cells , and enhancing ex vivo cytokine secretion after stimulation .
OBJECTIVE : Prior evidence suggests that dietary lignans may mitigate inflammation , attenuate insulin resistance , and improve blood lipids . Little is known about the effects of lignans in pregnant women who are at elevated risk of glucose and lipid abnormalities , partially due to increase in estrogen levels during pregnancy . This study was designed to investigate the association between dietary lignan intake , measured as urinary enterolignans ( enterodiol and enterolactone ) , with blood biomarkers of cardiometabolic risks in pregnant women . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : We analyzed data from 480 pregnant women who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) 1999 2010 and had data for urinary enterolignan concentrations . Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to examine the association between urinary enterolignan concentrations and cardiometabolic risk biomarkers . Cardiometabolic risk markers were log transformed and geometric means were calculated by quartiles of urinary enterolignan concentrations . RESULTS : Higher urinary enterolignan concentrations were associated with a more beneficial cardiometabolic profile : comparing women in the highest versus lowest quartiles of total enterolignan concentrations , high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL C ) was 62 versus 54 mg/dL ( P for trend = 01 ) ; triacylglycerol ( TG ) was 141 versus 171 mg/dL ( P for trend = 004 ) ; TG/HDL C ratio was 3 versus 2 ( P for trend = 001 ) ; Total cholesterol ( TC ) /HDL C ratio was 4 versus 9 ( P for trend = 03 ) ; C reactive protein ( CRP ) was 4 versus 7 mg/dL ( P for trend = 01 ) ; and fasting insulin was 7 versus 9 muU/mL ( P for trend < 0001 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Lignan intake may have favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk markers in pregnant women . KEY MESSAGES : The results of our study showed that urinary excretion of enterolignans were inversely associated with cardiometabolic risk markers in pregnant women . These findings support further investigation on the role of lignans in modifying lipid and glucose metabolism . Given the high prevalence of maternal insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia and its serious health consequences for both women and their offspring , the use of lignans , if demonstrated to be efficacious , could provide a cost effective option for curbing this epidemic by prevention and early treatment .
BACKGROUND : Standard dosing regimens of meropenem and piperacillin tazobactam frequently fail to achieve targeted plasma concentrations in critically ill patients . Extended or continuous regimens are often used to improve target attainment . Although prompt antibiotic initiation is a major determinant of survival , few studies have reported systemic concentrations early after treatment initiation . No prior study has reported concentrations immediately after the loading dose and first extended infusion . This study aimed to evaluate plasma target attainment during the first dosing interval with an extended infusion regimen in a general intensive care unit ( ICU ) . METHODS : Adult ICU patients were prospectively included in conjunction with the first administration of meropenem or piperacillin tazobactam . Treatment was initiated with a 5 h loading dose immediately followed by a 3 h extended infusion ; typically 4 + 4 g piperacillin or 1 ( 2 ) g + 1 ( 2 ) g meropenem , in line with the local ICU protocol . Patients requiring renal replacement therapy were excluded . Plasma concentrations were measured post loading dose ( C ( max ) ) , near the end of the first extended infusion , and at the end of the first dosing interval ( C ( min ) ) . Samples were analyzed using validated tandem mass spectrometry ( UHPLC MS/MS ) methods . The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving 100% time above minimum inhibitory concentrations ( fT > MIC ) during the first dosing interval . This was evaluated using observed C ( min ) above 2 mg/L ( meropenem ) and 20 mg/L ( piperacillin ) . Additionally , published pharmacokinetic models were applied to the observed data for %fT > MIC estimation , using an a posteriori Bayesian approach . RESULTS : We included 65 meropenem and 142 piperacillin measurements from 22 and 48 patients , respectively . Many patients ( 45% meropenem , 38% piperacillin ) failed to reach 100% fT > MIC with the standard regimens used . Target non attainment was associated with high estimated glomerular filtration rates ( eGFR ) and suspected augmented renal clearance ( ARC ) . All meropenem patients that failed to reach target had eGFR > 90 mL/min/73 m , as did 76% of corresponding piperacillin patients . Patients with suspected ARC frequently exhibited a tenfold or greater peak to trough decline ( C ( min ) /C ( max ) < 1 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Despite aggressive dosing , plasma concentrations often fail to reach 100% fT > MIC during the first dosing interval . Alternative regimens and early plasma concentration measurements followed by adaptive dose adjustments should be considered to improve target attainment .
BACKGROUND : Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) results in chronic motor deficits and intractable neuropathic pain , driven by neuroinflammation and impaired tissue repair . Current therapies inadequately address these multifaceted challenges . This study investigated the therapeutic effects of human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells ( hADSCs ) transplantation combined with green light ( GL ) therapy to modulate inflammation , enhance autophagy , and facilitate functional restoration post SCI . METHODS : In a murine SCI model , hADSCs ( 1 x 10 cells ) were intraspinally delivered with concurrent GL irradiation ( 100 lux , 8 h/d ) . Behavioral assessments included footprint analysis , von Frey test , and thermal hyperalgesia testing . Histological analyses included Luxol Fast Blue ( LFB ) , Nissl , Masson , and hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) staining for myelin integrity , neuronal survival and glial scar area . Immunofluorescence , ELISA and qPCR were used to assess inflammation , and autophagy related proteins were analyzed using immunofluorescence and western blotting . The role of microglial autophagy was investigated by inhibiting autophagy using 3 methyladenine ( 3MA ) . RESULTS : The combined treatment group ( hADSCs + GL ) showed significant motor function recovery , pain relief , and histological improvement , outperforming either treatment alone . Histological analyses revealed enhanced myelin preservation , reduced glial scar formation , and increased neuronal survival . Quantitative analysis revealed that TNF alpha , IL 1beta , and CD68 expression in the combined treatment group were markedly lower than those in single treatment cohorts ( P < 05 ) . Furthermore , the combined treatment promoted microglia autophagy , evidenced by increased Beclin1 and LC3B expression and decreased P62 in microglia . Inhibition of autophagy with 3MA reversed the anti inflammatory benefits of the combined therapy , exacerbating the inflammatory response . CONCLUSIONS : The combined treatment of hADSCs transplantation and GL therapy significantly improves functional recovery and reduces inflammation following SCI . The therapeutic effects are mediated in part by the modulation of microglial autophagy .
BACKGROUND : Lemur Tail Kinase 3 ( LMTK3 ) promotes cell proliferation , invasiveness and therapy resistance , and its expression correlates with poor survival in several different malignancies , including breast cancer . Crosstalk through extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) is an increasingly appreciated mechanism of cell communication within the tumour immune microenvironment , which contributes to different aspects of cancer progression and plays a pivotal role in shaping tumour fate . METHODS : Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the effects of LMTK3 on EV size , while single particle interferometry allowed us to examine LMTK3 dependent effects on the subpopulation distribution of EVs . Quantitative mass spectrometry was used to profile LMTK3 dependent proteomics changes in breast cancer derived EVs . Bioinformatics analysis of clinical data along with in vitro and cell based assays were implemented to explore the effects of LMTK3 dependent EV protein cargo on the tumour immune microenvironment . To elucidate the mechanism through which LMTK3 impacts endosomal trafficking and regulates EV biogenesis , we used a variety of approaches , including in vitro kinase assays , confocal and electron microscopy , as well as in vivo subcutaneous and orthotopic breast cancer mouse models . RESULTS : Here , we report that LMTK3 increases the average size of EVs , modulates immunoregulatory EV proteomic cargo and alters the subpopulation distribution of EVs released by breast cancer cells . Mechanistically , we provide evidence that LMTK3 phosphorylates Rab7 , a key regulator of multivesicular body ( MVB ) trafficking , thereby reducing the fusion of MVBs with lysosomes and subsequent degradation of intralumenal vesicles , resulting in altered EV release . Moreover , LMTK3 causes increased packaging of phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 ( PSAT1 ) in EVs , leading to a paracrine upregulation of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase ( PHGDH ) in monocytes when these EVs are taken up . PSAT1 and PHGDH play key roles in the serine biosynthesis pathway , which is closely linked to cancer progression and regulation of monocyte behaviour . LMTK3 EV induced elevated PHGDH expression in monocytes reduces their infiltration into breast cancer 3D spheroids and in vivo breast cancer mouse models . Furthermore , these infiltrating monocytes preferentially differentiate into pro tumourigenic M2 like macrophages . Additional breast cancer mouse studies highlight the contribution of LMTK3 dependent EVs in the observed immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype . Finally , in vitro experiments show that pharmacological inhibition of LMTK3 reverses the pro tumourigenic and immunomodulatory effects mediated by EVs derived from LMTK3 overexpressing cells . CONCLUSION : Overall , this study advances our knowledge on the mechanisms of EV biogenesis and highlights a novel oncogenic role of LMTK3 in the breast TME , further supporting it as a target for cancer therapy .
Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is characterized by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and a persistent inflammatory microenvironment dominated by M1 macrophages , both of which contribute to disease progression . To address these pathological features , we developed a core shell nanoplatform consisting of silver modified ceria nanoparticles loaded with celastrol ( Ag CeNP@Cel ) . This nanoplatform significantly enhances the water solubility of celastrol and reduces its hepato renal toxicity by enabling passive accumulation in inflamed joints . The silver modified ceria nanoparticles synergistically combine with celastrol to scavenge excess ROS and reprogram M1 macrophages into M2 macrophages , thereby mitigating inflammatory responses and improving the rheumatoid arthritis microenvironment ( RAM ) . Ag CeNP@Cel exhibited robust therapeutic efficacy and safety in preclinical models , presenting an innovative approach to RA treatment by integrating ROS elimination with macrophage modulation to ameliorate inflammatory microenvironment . This study underscores the potential of Ag CeNP@Cel as a promising therapeutic strategy for RA management .
Obesity poses serious health risks and is trending younger , developing effective strategies to prevent obesity is crucial . Calcium intake is a potential strategy to reduce weight/fat , as it generally enhances the body ' s energy metabolism . However , calcium ' s effects on appetite and its specific mechanisms remain unclear . To investigate these questions , we administered calcium orally to fasted mice and found that calcium inhibited food intake during the first 3 h . Long term calcium supplementation in water decreased HFD intake , weight gain , and fat deposition while increasing energy metabolism in young mice . Mechanistically , calcium activated the vagal afferent nerves and inhibited ARC ( AgRP ) neurons key appetite regulation neuron . What ' s more , these effects are blunted by chemogenetic inhibition of gastrointestinal intestinal vagal afferent nerves or activation of ARC ( AgRP ) neuronal activity . Overall , we showed that ingested calcium activates vagal afferent nerves , inhibiting the activity of ARC ( AgRP ) neurons , thereby reducing food intake . This study supports calcium ' s role in obesity dietary therapy .
BACKGROUND : SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 , mutually exclusive catalytic ATPase subunits of human mammalian Switch/Sucrose Nonfermentable chromatin remodeling enzymes , function as tumor suppressor genes . SMARCA4 deficient adenocarcinoma ( SMARCA4 dADC ) is a relatively rare subtype of TTF1/P40 negative non small cell lung cancer . The concurrent presentation of SMARCA4 dADC and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with SMARCA2 ( also known as BRM ) loss in separate lobes of the same patient is even less common . This report describes such a case involving the simultaneous occurrence of these two tumor types in distinct locations within the lungs . CASE PRESENTATION : A 68 year old male presented with a three week history of vague pain in the right side of the chest , with no obvious trigger . Imaging revealed solid masses in the upper and lower lobes of the right lung with bilateral enlarged cervical lymph nodes . So , both of these masses underwent wedge resection . Histopathological examination confirmed that the lower lobe tumor was SMARCA4 dADC , while the upper lobe tumor was diagnosed as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma . Although histologically similar , both exhibiting predominantly solid sheets and complex glandular structures , the two tumors displayed distinct immunohistochemical and molecular profiles . The lower lobe mass showed complete loss of BRG1 protein expression and partial loss of BRM . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed negative expression of TTF1 , Napsin A , SALL4 , CD34 , and SOX2 , and positive expression of CK7 , pan Cytokeratin ( CK pan ) , and HepPar Molecular analysis identified mutations in SMARCA4 , KRAS , and STK Conversely , the upper lobe mass retained BRG1 expression but showed complete loss of BRM protein expression , and negative expression of SALL4 , CD34 , and HepPar 1 , positive expression of CK7 , CK pan , TTF1 , Napsin A , and SOX A KRAS mutation was also detected in this tumor . CONCLUSION : The simultaneous occurrence of SMARCA4 dADC and conventional adenocarcinoma in different locations within the same patient is exceedingly rare . However , the distinct immunophenotypic and molecular characteristics of SMARCA4 dADC differentiate it as a unique entity from conventional adenocarcinoma . We recommend including SMARCA4 in the marker panel used to evaluate TTF1 negative adenocarcinomas of potential or uncertain pulmonary origin . This report underscores the diagnostic challenge of concurrent SMARCA4 dADC and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma , proposing a standardized immunohistochemical workflow to guide therapeutic decisions .
BACKGROUND : Synaptic dysfunction is a relevant feature of Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) and Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) and can be quantified through the measurement of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) synaptic markers , such as the presynaptic proteins synaptosomal associated protein 25 kDa ( SNAP25 ) and vesicle associated membrane protein 2 ( VAMP2 ) . Plasma based assays for synaptic markers are also emerging . In neurodegenerative diseases , synaptic dysfunction can be directly driven by proteinopathies such as amyloidosis ( A ) , tauopathy ( T ) , and alpha synucleinopathy ( S ) , which in turn can be detected via CSF biomarkers . This observational study aimed to : ( i ) evaluate the concordance of SNAP25 and VAMP2 in CSF and plasma ; ( ii ) compare SNAP25 and VAMP2 concentrations in CSF and plasma across AD , PD , and control groups ; ( iii ) examine the impact on synaptic markers concentration of CSF alpha synuclein seed amplification assay ( alphaS SAA ) positivity ( S+ ) in AD , and ( iv ) of CSF amyloid/tau ( A+/T+ ) positivity in PD . METHODS : We included 80 AD patients ( preclinical , mild cognitive impairment [MCI] , and dementia stages ) , 47 PD patients , and 41 controls with other neurological diseases ( OND ) and known CSF A/T/S profiles . All AD and 5/47 PD patients were CSF A+/T+ , while 26/80 AD and all PD patients were CSF S+ . All OND had a non A+/T + and a S profile . SNAP25 and VAMP2 concentrations in CSF and plasma were measured using Simoa based immunoassays . RESULTS : CSF and plasma SNAP25 were positively correlated , but no correlation was observed for VAMP2 in these matrices . CSF and plasma SNAP25 and CSF VAMP2 were higher in AD compared to PD and OND . Synaptic markers were elevated in preclinical AD and remained stable across MCI AD and AD dementia stages . AD patients with CSF alphaS SAA positivity showed no significant difference in synaptic markers compared to those without CSF alphaS SAA positivity , independent of clinical stage . In PD , A+/T + patients had higher CSF and plasma SNAP25 ( 3 +/ 6 ; 9 +/ 5 pg/mL ) compared to non A+/T + PD ( 4 +/ 2 ; 3 +/ 3 pg/mL ) ( p < 001 and p < 01 , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS : SNAP25 reliably serves as a marker of synaptic injury when measured in both CSF and plasma , whereas VAMP2 demonstrates reliability exclusively in CSF . Both markers are primarily influenced by AD pathology and remain unaffected by alpha synucleinopathy , suggesting their potential in detecting AD related synaptic dysfunction .
BACKGROUND : Organoids have emerged as powerful tools in reproductive medicine and bioengineering , offering three dimensional ( 3D ) models that closely mimic native tissues . However , the development of protocols for generating healthy epithelial ovarian organoids ( OvaOs ) remains significantly underexplored , as most studies focus on ovarian cancer models . This work presents an effective protocol for generating healthy bovine OvaOs as a physiological and translational model for ovarian research , mimicking the anatomical and functional similarities between bovine and human ovarian surface epithelium ( OSE ) . RESULTS : Healthy bovine OvaOs were successfully derived using a mechanical enzymatic method with a predominant mechanical approach , which proved superior to exclusively enzymatic techniques that failed to yield an adequate number of OSE cells . The biological potential of the resulting OvaOs to establish long term organoid lines was demonstrated by their exponential growth over a 21 day culture period , extensive passaging capacity , and high viability after freeze thaw cycles . Histological analyses confirmed that healthy bovine OvaOs recapitulated OSE tissue characteristics , including the expression of Cytokeratin 18 , Vimentin , and CD44 , while the absence of Paired box gene 8 ( PAX8 ) expression excluded contamination by fimbrial cells . CONCLUSIONS : This study describes an effective mechanical protocol for deriving healthy OvaOs from bovine ovaries . These 3D models faithfully replicate the biological features of bovine OSE , with sustained viability across long term cultures , passaging , and freeze thaw cycles . These findings underscore their potential as translational models for advancing ovarian physiology research and adapting protocols to human ovarian tissue .
BACKGROUND : New drugs to treat Alzheimer s disease ( AD ) are urgently needed . Human triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( hTREM2 ) is a validated drug target which is genetically associated with AD . Existing anti hTREM2 antibodies were raised in animal immune systems , and subsequently humanized , which may incur immunological complications upon repeated preventive or therapeutic applications in vivo in AD patients . In addition , anti hTREM2 antibodies should be optimized for both , efficacy and safety . METHODS : A novel fully human monoclonal brain targeting anti hTREM2 antibody M07 TFN was created . Binding affinities , cell viabilities , and agonist potencies were investigated on rhTREM2 and in human microglia . Transcytosis assays modeled blood brain barrier translocation ( BBB ) . Behavior tests were carried out in 5 x familiar AD ( 5xFAD ) mice of both genders , to test for brain function and cognition as well as hippocampus dependent spatial memory using the Barnes maze . In addition , amyloid plaque formation was determined on brain sections at the end of the study . RESULTS : M07 TFN showed higher binding affinities and stronger activation of hTREM2 signaling than all previously described anti hTREM2 antibodies . p Syk activation was increased 30 fold in hTREM2 overexpressing HEK293 cells and fourfold in human microglia cells compared to baseline . Human microglia viability significantly improved after stress testing . M07 TFN showed strong BBB translocation in a human BBB model , and exerted cross reactivity to the mouse TREM2 stalk region , which allowed us to investigate M07 TFN directly in an AD mouse model . In 5xFAD mice , M07 TFN resulted in improved novel object location and better spatial orientation and memory , and significantly reduced plaque load . Additional safety investigations in mice showed no negative effects on blood cells or major organs . CONCLUSION : Compared to existing humanized anti hTREM2 antibodies that have been investigated in clinical trials , M07 TFN showed best in class affinities and agonist potencies . Being a fully human anti hTREM2 antibody , M07 TFN holds the promise of reduced immunogenicity for use in human patients .
BACKGROUND : Crush syndrome is a severe condition caused by the systemic effects of rhabdomyolysis due to prolonged muscle compression . Common in disasters like earthquakes , it poses life threatening risks , including acute renal failure , hyperkalemia , and metabolic acidosis . Although surgical interventions such as fasciotomy and amputation are critical in its management , the optimal timing and criteria remain unclear . This study investigates the impact of surgical intervention timing on crush syndrome outcomes , providing guidance through the first experimental rat model evaluating fasciotomy and amputation post injury . METHODS : Forty eight Wistar albino rats were divided into six groups . Rhabdomyolysis was induced experimentally , followed by amputation or fasciotomy at 0 , 12 , or 24 h . The control group underwent rhabdomyolysis induction without surgery . Weekly urine samples were collected during the study , and blood , muscle , and kidney tissues were examined biochemically and histopathologically at the experiment ' s end . Data analysis focused on the systemic and tissue specific effects of intervention timing . RESULTS : Early intervention groups ( 0 h ) demonstrated minimal muscle inflammation and necrosis , preserved muscle fiber arrangement , and more pronounced regeneration . Late interventions ( 12 and 24 h ) were associated with intense inflammation , necrosis , edema , and hemorrhage in muscle tissue . Immediate amputation ( 0 h ) limited toxic metabolite effects , reducing kidney inflammation and damage . Late interventions showed increased interstitial nephritis and inflammatory cell infiltration in kidney tissue . Biochemical analyses revealed that urinary myoglobin levels decreased and renal function was preserved in the early intervention groups . CONCLUSIONS : The timing of surgical intervention is critical in managing crush syndrome . Early amputation and fasciotomy minimized necrosis and inflammation in muscle tissue , supported tissue regeneration , and reduced systemic complications by preventing toxic metabolite accumulation in the kidneys . Early amputation particularly showed superior renal protection and lower systemic complication risks compared to late interventions . These findings highlight the importance of timely surgical action and provide valuable insights for developing effective treatment strategies in disaster settings . However , the descriptive nature of the study and the fact that the data obtained from the experimental model cannot be directly applied to clinical practice should be taken into account . Therefore , the findings should be supported by future clinical trials .
Oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) was the most common malignant type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) with a low survival rate . The microbiota in oral cavity or tumor tissues may play a critical role in the OSCC . In this study , we characterized the microbiota from oral cancer tissues , oral swabs and saliva of patients with OSCC using 16S rRNA sequencing . We found differential profiles and amounts of microbiota in oral cancer tissues compared with adjacent tissues , as well as in oral swabs and saliva from OSCC patients compared with healthy individuals . Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas endodontalis were found increased in cancer tissues and saliva from OSCC patients . Prevotella melaninogenica was found increased in the saliva and oral swabs from OSCC patients . These data suggested that microbiota varied according to different samples . Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) analysis indicated an important role of metabolic pathways in the interaction between microbiota and cancers . Then we analyzed the metabolites from cancer tissues and saliva of OSCC patients by liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry ( LC MS/MS ) and gas chromatograph mass spectrometry ( GC MS ) . Differential profiles of metabolites were also observed in the cancer tissues compared with adjacent tissues and in the saliva from OSCC patients compared with healthy individuals . It showed that denticulaflavonol was significantly increased while D mannose was significantly decreased in both cancer tissues and saliva of OSCC patients . Taken together , these results suggested an association between microbiota/metabolites ( such as Fusobacterium and mannose ) and OSCC , in which the molecular mechanism need further investigated .
BACKGROUND : Hepatic clonorchiasis is one of the most prevalent foodborne parasitic diseases in China and is often overlooked because the initial symptoms are not obvious . In this study , a multivariate model for the early prediction of disease onset using laboratory test data from liver fluke infected patients was developed and validated . METHODS : Laboratory data from 147 liver fluke infected patients and 151 healthy control subjects were collected . Univariate logistic regression , Spearman correlation analysis , and collinearity diagnosis were used to screen for independent factors . A multivariate model was then constructed using the backward likelihood ratio method . For external validation , an independent patient cohort from another hospital was analyzed . The discriminative performance of the combined model was compared with that of previously identified biomarkers ( eosinophil count and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ) . RESULTS : A 12 indicator prediction model for liver fluke infection was developed using traditional logistic regression ( 31% sensitivity and 08% specificity ) . The receiver operating characteristic curve , calibration curve , and decision curve analyses revealed that the model exhibited excellent discriminative ability ( area under the curve [AUC] : training = 928 , validation = 808 ) , goodness of fit , and clinical practicability . The combined model showed superior discrimination compared with individual biomarkers , including eosinophil count ( AUC = 577 ) and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ( AUC = 620 ) . CONCLUSIONS : This study developed an early risk prediction model for liver fluke infection using routine laboratory test data . Compared with previously reported biomarkers , the model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance and showed potential as a clinical tool for identifying early stage liver fluke infection in patients .
BACKGROUND : Outcomes in glioblastoma are improved by surgical resection and adjuvant radiation ( RT ) . In primary GBM ( pGBM ) , large clinical target volume ( CTV ) margins typically cover occult invasion . In recurrent GBM ( rGBM ) , RT often uses tiny CTV margins that likely omit occult invasion due to re RT radiation necrosis concerns . Whole brain spectroscopic MRI ( sMRI ) is an emerging technique with similar resolution to PET that may help define the CTV for rGBM . METHODS : Patients with pGBM ( n = 18 ) and rGBM ( n = 19 ) underwent sMRI with RT simulation . T1 post contrast ( T1PC ) and T2/FLAIR MRI volumes were contoured . sMRI generated choline/N acetylaspartate > 2x ( Cho/NAA > 2x ) volumes are known to correlate with high risk invasion . Hausdorff distances were calculated to define the margin necessary to cover Cho/NAA > 2x in pGBM and rGBM . In rGBM , mock CTV expansions from T1PC volumes were created to determine non selective CTV expansion sizes needed to cover Cho/NAA > 2x volumes . RESULTS : For pGBM , the median T1PC , Cho/NAA > 2x , and T2/FLAIR volumes were 3 cc , 0 cc , and 8 cc respectively . For rGBM , the median T1PC , Cho/NAA > 2x , and T2/FLAIR volumes were 7 cc , 9 cc , and 3 cc , respectively . T2/FLAIR volumes increased more relative to T1PC volumes in rGBM than pGBM ( p </= 001 ) . Meanwhile , the median Hausdorff distance between T1PC and Cho/NAA > 2x was 9 mm in pGBM and 7 mm in rGBM , suggesting that the high risk volume does not significantly change . In rGBM , it is common to use no CTV expansion from the T1PC volume which only included 61% of high risk Cho/NAA > 2x volume . Conversely , T1PC expansions of 10 , 15 , and 20 mm covered 87% , 94% , and 98% of Cho/NAA > 2x volume . CONCLUSIONS : sMRI Cho/NAA > 2x delineates high risk occult disease in glioblastoma and extends beyond T1PC MRI borders . Typical large CTV expansions in pGBM mostly include Cho/NAA > 2x volumes . However , small CTV expansions commonly used in rGBM poorly cover Cho/NAA > 2x , suggesting that larger CTV expansions or Cho/NAA > 2x guidance may be of benefit .
BACKGROUND : Disaccharide polyene macrolides exhibit superior water solubility and significantly reduced hemolytic toxicity compared to their monosaccharide counterparts , making them promising candidates for safer antifungal therapeutics . In this study , we engineered a Streptomyces gilvosporeus ( pSET152 nppY ) capable of producing disaccharide pimaricin ( DSP ) through heterologous expression of the nppY gene , which encodes a glycosyltransferase responsible for the second sugar extension in the biosynthetic pathway . RESULTS : The novel compound was structurally characterized and designated disaccharide pimaricin ( DSP ) , featuring an aglycone identical to pimaricin and a unique disaccharide moiety ( mycosaminyl alpha1 4 N acetylglucosamine ) . A purification protocol for DSP was established . Compared to pimaricin , DSP demonstrated a 50% reduction in antifungal activity , a 6 fold decrease in hemolytic toxicity , and a remarkable 6 fold increase in water solubility . Growth analysis revealed a delayed growth cycle in the mutant strain , suggesting that nppY expression may impose additional metabolic burden . Optimization of the fermentation medium using a statistical design identified an optimal formulation , with a maximum DSP titer of 168 mg/L . CONCLUSIONS : This study underscores the potential of disaccharide polyene macrolides as safer antifungal agents and establishes a robust framework for engineering strains to produce these compounds . The findings provide critical insights into balancing biosynthetic efficiency and strain fitness , advancing the development of next generation polyene antibiotics .
BACKGROUND : Proteases are important enzymes in food and pharmaceutical industries , but challenges persist in their recombinant production due to host cell proteome hydrolysis and fitness loss . The development of recombinant expression systems for directed evolution of proteolytic enzymes , and industrial production are desirable . This study evaluated Saccharomyces cerevisiae as expression host for three bacterial proteases : BdpK ( from Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus ) , IdeS , and SpeB ( both from Streptococcus pyogenes ) , each with distinct peptide substrate scopes . RESULTS : We developed an experimental pipeline for analysis of protease gene expression levels and fitness effects on yeast cultures . Heterologous genes were fused with green fluorescent protein and their expression and effects on cell viability was monitored at the single cell level by flow cytometry . IdeS GFP fusion was produced efficiently with a gaussian distribution within the population and without compromising cell growth or viability . BdpK , on the other hand , displayed lower expression level and a more heterogenous distribution that was less stable over time . Production of SpeB was not feasible . Inserting the speB GFP fusion gene resulted in complete growth inhibition and a significantly higher frequency of cells with compromised membrane integrity . Plasmid based expression was compared with integrated based expression , revealing higher total expression levels and lower degree of population heterogeneity for the latter . CONCLUSIONS : S . cerevisiae was found to be an efficient expression host for the bacterial protease IdeS . In contrast , the expression of BdpK and SpeB faced significant challenges , including lack of activity for BdpK , or imposing a substantial fitness burden on the cells for SpeB , likely due to its broad substrate scope resulting in native protein degradation . The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the limitations and possibilities of yeast as an expression host for bacterial protease production and for studying their physiological effects using yeast as a model eukaryote .
Overweight and obesity are major risk factors for heart failure ( HF ) , contributing to its development through metabolic , neurohormonal , haemodynamic , and inflammatory alterations . While overweight/obesity increases the risk of developing HF , its impact on patient outcomes remains complex . The " obesity paradox " suggests that a higher BMI may be associated with improved survival in patients with established HF . However , recent GLP 1 receptor agonist ( GLP 1 RA ) trials suggest that intentional weight loss positively influences outcomes in overweight/obese patients with HF . This seemingly contradictory evidence highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms linking adiposity to HF outcomes . A more precise characterization of adiposity phenotypes using alternative and accurate measures of pathological fat accumulation is crucial in identifying individuals who may benefit most from anti obesity treatments . In this context , recent research underscores the role of epicardial adipose tissue ( EAT ) in HF pathophysiology , as it directly influences cardiac function and structure through inflammatory , metabolic , and mechanical effects . This narrative review summarises current evidence on the impact of weight loss on HF outcomes , focusing on recent GLP 1 RA trial results . Additionally , it highlights epidemiological and molecular data supporting EAT as a novel adiposity measure that might allow refining patient selection for pharmacological weight loss treatments . Finally , it emphasizes the need for future research to identify causal pathways linking alternative measures of visceral fat accumulation to HF outcomes . These efforts will be essential in optimizing the benefits of novel weight loss treatments , ensuring effective and individualized therapeutic strategies for overweight or obese patients with HF .
BACKGROUND : Patients affected by inherited metabolic diseases ( IMDs ) , through effective newborn screening and better clinical management , are living longer and have a lower burden of disease ; this rises the challenge of properly taking life long care of them as they age . This study aims to assess the Italian experience with the transition of patients affected by IMDs from pediatrician to adult care , focusing on the dietetic approach as well . For this purpose , a survey was created on REDCap ( R ) and distributed via email to the members of the " Dietetics and Nutrition Working Group " and " Inherited Metabolic Diseases in Adults Working Group " of " Italian IMD and Newborn Screening Society " ( SIMMESN ) ; dissemination was possible with the collaboration of MetabERN . RESULTS : A total of 49 complete responses were collected 28 from medical doctors ( MDs ) and 21 from dietitians from 35 different centers . Considering the MDs , 13 take care of pediatric patients ; the remaining 15 , with heterogeneous specialization , of adults with IMDs . Considering the dietitians , only 6 deal with IMDs patients as their full time activity . Out of the 35 centers , 19 do not have a transition program ( while 10/19 are already trying to implement it ) ; the main barrier identified to the implementation voted by 42% of participants is represented by the lack of identification of a suitable facility . Considering the 16 centers that already have a transition program , the 2 main difficulties reported by 43% of participants were the lack of a psychologist for adult centers and the lack of specific training in IMDs on the adult service team ; this last option was also the most voted by the dietitians ( 44% ) . CONCLUSIONS : The administered survey allows us to capture the state of transition programs in Italy , the lack of homogeneity in those centers that already have one , and the obstacles to developing a new program . What unequivocally emerged is the need for standardization of the transition program and for delineating a path to train MDs specialized in treating adult patients with IMDs , as well as dedicated dietitians .
BACKGROUND : The link between vitamin D and cancer remains inconclusive . In this study , we aimed to explore the relationship between circulating vitamin D levels and overall and site specific cancers in Korean adults using data from two large prospective cohort studies . METHODS : Baseline serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25 ( OH ) D] levels were measured in a subset of participants from the Cardiovascular Disease Association Study ( 2005 2012 ) and the Health Examinees Study ( 2009 2013 ) . We followed 46 , 514 adults aged >/= 40 years who consented to linkage with national cancer registry data . Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios ( HRs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) for cancer incidence according to quartiles of season standardized 25 ( OH ) D levels . RESULTS : The median season standardized 25 ( OH ) D level was 6 nmol/L ( interquartile range : 6 7 nmol/L ) . During the median follow up of 6 years , 3 , 529 incident cancer cases were recorded . Compared with the first quartile , the upper quartiles of serum 25 ( OH ) D were associated with a lower risk of overall cancer [HR ( 95% CI ) : 86 ( 77 95 ) , 84 ( 75 93 ) , and 80 ( 72 89 ) , respectively ; P for trend < 001] . For site specific cancers , the HRs ( 95% CIs ) for the comparison of extreme quartiles of serum 25 ( OH ) D were 72 ( 52 99 ) for colorectal cancer , 32 ( 21 50 ) for liver cancer , and 75 ( 55 04 ) for lung cancer . Upon categorization of serum 25 ( OH ) D levels based on absolute cut off points , participants with levels >/= 75 nmol/L had significantly lower risks of overall , liver , and lung cancers compared with those with levels < 30 nmol/L . CONCLUSIONS : These findings suggest that higher 25 ( OH ) D levels are associated with a lower risk of overall and some site specific cancers in the Korean population .

Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) and atherosclerosis ( AS ) are two interacting diseases mostly affecting aged adults . AD is characterized by the deposition of neuritic plaques mainly consisting of Abeta , and AS is defined by the formation of atheromatous plaque along the vascular wall . The shared mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD and AS remain unclear . Here we applied several bioinformatic analyses of bulk sequencing data sets of AD brain tissues and atherosclerotic plaques to seek relevant genes between AD and AS . WIPF3 , was identified as the most affected gene in both diseases using weighted gene co expression network analysis , machine learning based Lasso Cox regression analysis and random forest analysis . Furthermore , immune cell infiltration analysis of AS data sets and cell portion of single cell RNA sequencing data from AD patients revealed an essential role of inflammation in the co occurrence of AD and AS . Taken together , WIPF3 deficiency and inflammation may simultaneously mediate both AD and AS and could be potential targets for the prevention and therapy of these two closely related diseases .
BACKGROUND : The tumor microenvironment ( TME ) plays a pivotal role in cancer progression , with cancer associated fibroblasts ( CAFs ) significantly influencing tumor behavior . Especially , elevated COX2 expressing fibroblasts within the TME , notably in collagen dense tumors like breast cancer , has been recently emphasized in the literature . However , the specific effect of COX2 expressing CAFs ( COX2 ( + ) CAFs ) on neighboring cells and their consequent role in cancer progression is not fully elucidated . METHODS : We induced COX2 ( + ) fibroblasts by forcing the fibroblasts forming aggregates to undergo Nemosis as a proxy for COX2 ( + ) CAFs . This approach enabled us to simulate the paracrine interactions between COX2 ( + ) CAFs and normal breast epithelial cells via conditioned media from COX2 ( + ) fibroblasts . We developed an innovative in vitro platform that combines cell mechanics based analysis and biomolecular assays to study the interactions between COX2 ( + ) fibroblasts and normal breast epithelial cells . By focusing on the mechanical characteristics of the cells and the epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) marker expressions , we aimed to elucidate the paracrine mechanisms through which COX2 ( + ) CAFs influence the tumor microenvironment . RESULTS : Our in vitro findings demonstrate that COX2 ( + ) fibroblasts , through conditioned media , induce significant alterations in the mechanical behavior of normal breast epithelial cells , as evidenced by monolayer expansion measurements using traction force microscopy ( TFM ) . This transition was further corroborated by single cell morphology and motility analyses , as well as increased expression of mesenchymal markers , including SNAI1 at the mRNA level and vimentin at the protein level . EP4 inhibition partially reversed these changes , preserving cell cell interactions , limiting monolayer expansion , and reducing mesenchymal like features , suggesting that PGE2 EP4 signaling plays a key role in mediating the paracrine effects of COX2 ( + ) fibroblasts . Together , our findings support a model in which PGE2 EP4 signaling contributes to EMT induction , potentially involving SNAI1 regulation , with implications for targeting stromal epithelial interactions in breast cancer . CONCLUSION : This study advances our understanding of the potential mechanisms by which COX2 ( + ) CAFs influence tumor progression within the breast tumor microenvironment ( TME ) through controlled in vitro investigations . By integrating cell mechanics based analysis , biomolecular assays , and innovative in vitro cell based modeling of COX2 ( + ) CAFs , we have delineated the contributory role of these cells in a controlled setting . These insights lay a groundwork for future studies that could explore the implications of these findings in vivo , potentially guiding targeted therapeutic strategies .
BACKGROUND : Alternative splicing ( AS ) is consistently linked to tumor progression . SRSF1 , the first identified proto oncogene in the serine/arginine rich splicing factor ( SRSF ) protein family , plays a crucial role . However , the specific functions and potential mechanisms of SRSF1 in advancing bladder cancer ( BCa ) progression and influencing chemosensitivity remain largely unexplored . METHODS : The expression of SRSF1 in BCa tissues and cell lines was investigated using quantitative real time PCR ( RT qPCR ) and western blotting . Survival analysis was employed to examine the association between SRSF1 expression and prognosis of BCa . The functions of SRSF1 were evaluated through proliferation assays , migration assays , IC50 determination assays , and tumorigenesis assays in nude mice . Subsequent RNA sequencing validated the relationship between SRSF1 alternative splicing and the mitophagy pathway . Mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP ) was assessed using JC 1 staining . Mitophagy and autophagic flux were quantified using transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence imaging . RNA immunoprecipitation , CUT & RUN assays , and luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate the SRSF1/HIF1A/BNIP3 axis . RESULTS : High expression of SRSF1 in BCa was significantly associated with poor prognosis . SRSF1 promoted the progression of BCa cells and conferred resistance to cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo . Mechanistically , SRSF1 interacted with pre HIF1A via the RRM1/RRM2 domain , thereby enhancing the production of the transcription factor HIF1A through the alternative splicing pathway . This interaction subsequently activated the HIF1A/BNIP3 axis , which promoted mitophagy in BCa . Ultimately , this led to further progression of bladder cancer and a decrease in cisplatin sensitivity . CONCLUSIONS : SRSF1 indicated poor prognosis and promoted the progression and cisplatin resistance of BCa cells through the HIF1A/BNIP3/mitophagy axis . It holds significant potential as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of BCa , particularly in chemotherapy .
BACKGROUND : Socioeconomic determinants of health ( SDH ) account for about 40% of modifiable determinants of health , followed by health behaviours ( 30% ) , clinical care ( 20% ) and physical environmental factors ( 10% ) . The " 10/90 gap " is the idea that only 10% of global health research is devoted to conditions that account for 90% of the global disease burden . For over a decade , SDH research centres have been established in Iran to generate evidence and address SDH . OBJECTIVE : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the activities and challenges faced by SDH research centres and identify knowledge gaps . METHODS : We systematically categorized 759 approved projects ( 2012 2022 ) from 29 SDH centres using predefined themes ( e . g . mental health , COVID 19 , social inequalities ) . Interrater reliability was ensured through dual independent coding , with discrepancies resolved by consensus . In addition , a bibliometric analysis of 5892 PubMed indexed articles was conducted using VOSviewer , a validated tool for mapping research trends and collaborations . This phase provided objective insights into publication patterns , keyword clusters and interdisciplinary networks . Finally , semi structured surveys were conducted with SDH researchers to identify knowledge gaps and prioritize research areas . Prioritization criteria ( e . g . disease burden , equity impact ) were scored using a five point Likert scale , and the results were validated through an expert panel to ensure alignment with real world challenges . RESULTS : Out of the 759 approved research projects gathered from 29 reviewed centres , 79 projects were related to mental health , and 53 were related to coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID 19 ) . A total of 5892 articles from 35 research centres obtained by searching PubMed were reviewed and analysed with VOS viewer software . The most frequently used keywords in the centres ' published works are COVID 19 , meta analysis , systematic review , depression , anxiety , and quality of life . In 11 clusters , the 35 research centres under investigation collaborate with 82 additional research centres . Measuring different SDHs at the population level and carrying out related interventions cost far more than the centres ' annual budget . Because of this and other factors stated in the results section , the research centres have shifted their focus to smaller research and more accessible and limited groups and subjects . CONCLUSIONS : There is a mismatch between the subjects that the research centres ' researchers believe should be studied and the approved projects of the centres , as is evident from a review of the centres ' projects and their opinions . Numerous issues may be the root of these discrepancies , such as methods for ranking research subjects , methods for selecting study target groups , how to assess research centres and the different criteria set by colleges and universities .
BACKGROUND : Cadaverine , displaying potential in medicine , agriculture and polyamide production , is biologically produced through L lysine decarboxylation . Considering the potential of the polyamide market , its biological production has been focused on with following diverse efforts to improve the production . In Escherichia coli , lysine decarboxylase exists in two forms : CadA and LdcC , and it is known that CadA exhibits superior catalytic activity compared to LdcC . Despite its potential , cadaverine production is limited due to increased intracellular pH , which destabilizes the decameric structure of CadA and inhibits its activity . RESULTS : In this study , based on the structural analysis , a chimeric CadA enzyme , CL2 , was engineered by replacing its pH sensitive region with a structurally stable counterpart derived from LdcC . The resulting BLCL2 strain with CL2 produced 12 g/L of cadaverine 96 times higher than BLC strain with the wild type CadA in flask culture . Compared to the wild type CadA , structural modifications enhanced pH stability and improved the affinity of CadA toward pyridoxal 5 phosphate ( PLP ) , its cofactor . CONCLUSIONS : This study developed the improved strains for cadaverine production by creating the new enzyme , which is validated by enhanced amount of cadaverine . In addition , the segmental swapping guided by structure analysis was exhibited as the one of effective method in protein engineering strategies . These advancements offer a promising approach to optimizing cadaverine biosynthesis for industrial applications .
Membrane contact sites are specialized regions where organelle membranes are in close proximity , enabling lipid transfer while preserving membrane identity . In plants , ER‒chloroplast contact sites are critical for maintaining glycerolipid homeostasis . This review examines the lipid modifying and lipid transfer proteins/complexes involved in these processes . Key proteins at these sites , including components of the TGD and VAP27‒ORP2A complexes , as well as Sec14 proteins , facilitate lipid exchange . Additionally , the roles of lipid modifying proteins at these contact sites are discussed . Despite significant progress , further research is needed to identify additional proteins , investigate ER‒chloroplast dynamics under stress and explore ER contact sites in non chloroplast plastids .
BACKGROUND : Short bowel syndrome ( SBS ) is a condition characterized by malabsorption that occurs when a patient loses a significant amount of bowel length or function , often necessitating lifelong parenteral nutrition support . This study utilized multi omics analysis to investigate alterations in gut microbiota , metabolism , and transcriptome during the progression of intestinal adaptation in SBS using a piglet model . METHODS : We established a model of SBS in Bama mini piglets by performing a 75% jejunoileal resection . Fifteen piglets were randomized into EN , PN , and PN SBS groups . Fecal samples were collected for 16 S rRNA gene based microbiota analysis . Ileal mucosa and serum were collected for untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry . Transcriptomic analysis on ileal mucosa was performed . RESULTS : The PN SBS model was established in the newborn piglets . A significant decrease in species level diversity was observed in piglets with SBS , accompanied by alterations in their microbiome compositions . The beneficial anaerobes from Bacillota and Bacteroidota were depleted while microorganisms from Verrucomicrobiota and Fusobacteriota were enriched in feces from SBS piglets . The dysregulation of metabolites and metabolic pathways was observed in the metabolic profiles of ileal mucosa and serum in SBS piglets . Indolelactic acid ( ILA ) levels were found to be reduced in the ileal mucosa and serum of SBS piglets . Transcriptomic analysis revealed an extensive functional alteration in SBS , primarily manifested as metabolic changes and intestinal proliferation . The multi omics analysis revealed that the decreased abundance of Lactobacillus may result in a diminished production of their metabolite ILA , thereby influencing intestinal proliferation and anti inflammatory responses . CONCLUSION : Disrupted homeostasis of gut microbiota , metabolism , and transcriptome were reported in the SBS piglets . Multi omics analysis demonstrated Lactobacillus and its metabolite ILA may be involved in small intestinal adaptation of SBS . These alterations may contribute to the proinflammatory state and the delay of intestinal adaptation in SBS , which in turn provide promising targets for therapies .
BACKGROUND : Glioblastoma ( GBM ) is a highly resistant tumor , and targeting its bioenergetics could be a potential treatment strategy . GBM cells depend on cytosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NADH ) , which is transported into the mitochondria via the malate aspartate shuttle ( MAS ) for ATP production . N phenylmaleimide ( KN612 ) is a MAS inhibitor that targets SLC25A11 , an antiporter protein of the MAS . Therefore , this study investigated the effects of KN612 in GBM treatment using in vitro and in vivo models . METHODS : We examined the biological effects of KN612 in GBM tumorspheres ( TSs ) , including its effects on cell viability , ATP level , cell cycle , stemness , invasive properties , energy metabolic pathways , and transcriptomes . Additionally , we investigated the in vivo efficacy of KN612 in a mouse orthotopic xenograft model . RESULTS : Transcriptomic analysis showed that SLC25A11 mRNA expression was significantly higher in GBM TSs than in normal human astrocytes . Additionally , siRNA mediated SLC25A11 knockdown and KN612 mediated MAS inhibition decreased the oxygen consumption rate , ATP levels , mitochondrial activity , and cell viability in GBM TSs and decreased the stemness and invasion ability of GBM cells . Moreover , gene ontology functional annotation indicated that KN612 treatment inhibited cell cycle and mitotic processes . Furthermore , KN612 treatment reduced tumor size and prolonged survival in an orthotopic xenograft model . CONCLUSIONS : Targeting GBM bioenergetics using KN612 may represent a novel and effective approach for GBM treatment .
BACKGROUND : Chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) is a significant global health challenge , with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) widely used as an effective treatment option . Despite TDF ' s efficacy in suppressing hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA , it rarely achieves functional cure , requiring hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) clearance or seroconversion , which are an optimal goal of CHB treatment . This study aimed to evaluate the long term effects of TDF monotherapy on HBsAg clearance rates through a systematic review and meta analysis , combined with a longitudinal modeling analysis to investigate HBsAg dynamics . METHODS : Eligible studies published between January 1st , 2008 , and September 28th , 2023 , in PubMed , EMBASE , and Web of Science were included in the systematic review and meta analysis . The longitudinal model was developed based on data from 123 subjects in a Phase III trial cohort . RESULTS : Twenty three studies were selected for meta analysis . The summarized HBsAg clearance rate was near zero and unlikely to increase with extended treatment . The longitudinal model of HBsAg dynamic in CHB patients receiving TDF monotherapy showed a good fitting performance and extrapolation predictive ability . Model based simulation confirmed that HBsAg clearance remained unlikely with prolonged therapy , with median HBsAg levels reducing by 21% after 168 weeks . CONCLUSIONS : The consistency between meta analysis and model simulation outcomes indicated that TDF monotherapy can achieve a limited reduction in HBsAg levels but did not result in functional cure , which reinforced the limited role of TDF monotherapy in comprehensive CHB management .
BACKGROUND : As machine learning ( ML ) continuously develops in cancer diagnosis and treatment , some researchers have attempted to predict the expression of programmed death ligand 1 ( PD L1 ) in non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) by ML . However , there is a lack of systematic evidence on the effectiveness of ML . METHODS : We conducted a thorough search across Embase , PubMed , the Cochrane Library , and Web of Science from inception to December 14th , A systematic review and meta analysis was conducted to assess the value of ML for predicting PD L1 expression in NSCLC . RESULTS : Totally 30 studies with 12 , 898 NSCLC patients were included . The thresholds of PD L1 expression level were < 1% , 1 49% , and >/= 50% . In the validation set , in the binary classification for PD L1 >/= 1% , the pooled C index was 646 ( 95%CI : 587 705 ) , 799 ( 95%CI : 782 817 ) , 806 ( 95%CI : 753 858 ) , and 800 ( 95%CI : 717 883 ) , respectively , for the clinical feature , radiomics , radiomics + clinical feature , and pathomics based ML models ; in the binary classification for PD L1 >/= 50% , the pooled C index was 649 ( 95%CI : 553 744 ) , 771 ( 95%CI : 728 814 ) , and 826 ( 95%CI : 783 869 ) , respectively , for the clinical feature , radiomics , and radiomics + clinical feature based ML models . CONCLUSIONS : At present , radiomics or pathomics based ML methods are applied for the prediction of PD L1 expression in NSCLC , which both achieve satisfactory accuracy . In particular , the radiomics based ML method seems to have wider clinical applicability as a non invasive diagnostic tool . Both radiomics and pathomics serve as processing methods for medical images . In the future , we expect to develop medical image based DL methods for intelligently predicting PD L1 expression .
BACKGROUND : While exercise training has been shown to improve various aspects of adolescent metabolic health , such as blood pressure , insulin resistance , and dyslipidemia , the underlying metabolic mechanisms remain poorly understood . No study has examined the metabolomic changes to identify potential mechanisms and explore biomarkers that predict exercise benefits in adolescents . METHODS : We used propensity score matching to select 54 pairs of adolescents ( ages 12 14 years ) with and without long term exercise training . Body mass index ( BMI ) , waist circumference ( WC ) and metabolic indicators including blood pressure , Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance ( HOMA IR ) and triglycerides ( TGs ) were assessed at enrollment and 1 year follow up . Untargeted metabolomics was analyzed at enrollment . The associations between metabolites and clinical metabolic indicators were tested . RESULTS : Metabolomic analysis revealed 73 differential metabolites between exercise and non exercise groups , with 59 metabolites associated with metabolic health indicators . Among them , a group of eicosanoids were consistently upregulated and negatively associated with diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) , HOMA IR , or TGs , suggesting their potential roles in exercise related improvements . Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed better predictive performance for exercise benefits on DBP and TGs using papaverine and azelaic acid compared to BMI and WC . CONCLUSIONS : Adolescents with long term exercise are associated with improved metabolic health . Metabolomic profiles provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms and offer useful biomarkers for predicting exercise benefits .
BACKGROUND : Cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia ( SCZ ) is associated with poor social functioning and long term prognosis . Our previous work suggests that some key fungal markers including Purpureocillium , are linked to SCZ . METHODS : We present a case control study that includes 136 first episode , drug naive patients with SCZ and 92 healthy controls ( HCs ) . Untargeted liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry ( LC/MS ) was utilized to measure serum metabolite levels . The abundance of Purpureocillium was assessed using the internal transcribed spacer ( ITS ) analysis . Cognitive function was measured using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery . RESULTS : The present study demonstrated significant declines in attention and alertness ( AV ) , speed of processing ( SOP ) in individuals with SCZ . The abundance of Purpureocillium was found to have a negative correlation with multiple domains of cognitive function . Additionally , SCZ related metabolic markers 2 Oxoarginine , N Acetyl serotonin , Ergothioneine , Isobutyric acid and Biotin were significantly associated with both the abundance of Purpureocillium and cognitive scores ( SOP and AV ) . Mediation analyses revealed that the abundance of Purpureocillium in patients with SCZ had significant direct and indirect effects on SOP and AV ) through metabolic markers ( 2 Oxoarginine , N Acetyl serotonin , Ergothioneine ) . Further , Purpureocillium and the metabolic markers were found to be correlated with inflammation and oxidative stress , both of which have been associated with pathogenesis of SCZ . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings suggest that Purpureocillium might be associated with cognitive impairments through its regulation on the metabolism of specific amino acids involved in inflammation and oxidative stress . A better understanding about the fungal immune metabolites association may lead to novel treatment approaches to improve cognitive function in patients with SCZ .
The potential of glioblastoma ( GBM ) photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) is limited by inadequate GBM drug delivery , and the development of resistance to PDT as a result of cellular damage response that critically involves the hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha ( HIF 1alpha ) and yes associated protein ( YAP ) . Herein , addressing these challenges , we demonstrated a strategy of photo controlled , targeted co delivery of verteporfin ( Vp ) , a photosensitizer and YAP inhibitor as well , and acriflavine ( Af ) , a HIF 1alpha inhibitor via platelets for enhanced GBM PDT . Mouse platelets were separately loaded with Vp ( Vp@Plt ) and Af ( Af@Plt ) and the mixture thereof is termed Vp@Plt + Af@Plt . Alternatively , platelets were simultaneously loaded with Vp and Af to yield ( Vp + Af ) @Plt . First , both Vp@Plt + Af@Plt and ( Vp + Af ) @Plt were shown to achieve rapid and efficient laser triggered , GBM targeted delivery of Vp and Af , which led to markedly higher phototoxicity in the GBM cells ( GBCs ) and ultimately more potent GBM PDT than Vp@Plt in mice . Next , a mechanistic study revealed the induction of a mutually promotional interaction of HIF 1alpha and YAP in the GBCs in response to PDT inflicted DNA damage . This interaction protected HIF 1alpha from degradation and meanwhile assisted in the nuclear translocation of YAP leading to increased nuclear presence of both HIF 1alpha and YAP and escalated DNA damage repair activity under their regulation . Both Af and Vp were found to block the PDT induced HIF 1alpha YAP interaction and thereby severely impaired DNA damage repair , eventually resulting in exacerbated cell death . In conclusion , Af and Vp can be adequately co delivered in GBM via platelets in a photo controlled manner to achieve efficacious GBM PDT through double blocking of the HIF 1alpha YAP interaction in the GBCs .
BACKGROUND : Life expectancy in high income countries remained lower in 2022 compared to pre pandemic levels in This study explores the deficit of life expectancy and excess of years of life lost ( YLL ) in Spain from 2020 to 2022 , assessing both direct effects of infectious diseases and indirect effects of other causes of death . METHODS : Data on life expectancy and YLL from 2010 to 2022 were obtained from the Spanish Institute for Statistics ( INE ) . Using linear regression , we estimated expected life expectancy and YLL for 2020 2022 under the assumption that pre pandemic trends ( 2010 2019 ) had continued . RESULTS : During the first year of the pandemic , Spanish women lost 10 years and men lost 40 years in life expectancy . By 2022 , life expectancy remained lower than in 2019 for both sexes . The excess YLL was similar across 2020 ( 40 million YLL and 3 YLL/100 people ) , 2021 ( 35 million YLL , 1 YLL/100 people ) , and 2022 ( 35 million YLL , 0 YLL/100 people ) . Approximately 70% of this excess was attributable to infectious diseases ( 87% in 2020 , 78% in 2021 , and 43% in 2022 ) . Other major contributors to excess YLL included external causes , circulatory diseases , digestive diseases , and endocrine , nutritional , and metabolic diseases , while cancer mortality did not show an excess during the pandemic period . CONCLUSIONS : Mortality in Spain in 2022 remained elevated compared to pre pandemic expectations . The contribution of non infectious diseases to excess mortality increased over time . TRIAL REGISTRATION : Not applicable .
BACKGROUND : Chronic bronchitis ( CB ) , as a core precursor of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) , is crucial for global disease burden prevention and control . Although the association between heavy metal exposure and respiratory damage has been preliminarily demonstrated , traditional linear models are difficult to resolve the nonlinear interactions and dose response heterogeneity . The aim of this study was to construct the first heavy metal exposure chronic bronchitis risk prediction model by integrating exposureomics data through machine learning ( ML ) . METHODS : Weighted logistic regression was used to assess the association of 14 blood and urine heavy metals with CB based on nationally representative samples from the 2005 2015 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) . The Boruta algorithm was further applied to screen the characteristic variables and construct 10 ML models . The best model was selected by four evaluation metrics : accuracy , specificity , sensitivity , and area under the ROC curve ( AUC ) , and the best model was visually interpreted using Shapley ' s additive interpretation ( SHAP ) . RESULTS : The multifactorial logistic regression model showed that urinary cadmium ( OR = 53 , 95% CI = 17 98 ) versus blood cadmium ( OR = 36 , 13 65 ) was an independent risk factor for CB . The CatBoost model had the best predictive performance ( AUC = 805 ) , with smoking as the most significant predictor , followed by blood cadmium concentration and gender . CONCLUSION : In this research , the first risk prediction diagnostic model for heavy metal chronic bronchitis was developed , in which CatBoost model had the best performance , and it provides a referenceable prediction model for the screening of high risk groups .
BACKGROUND : The aim of the study is to evaluate saliva levels of Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( suPAR ) , Hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha ( HIF 1alpha ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) in stage III grade A , grade B , grade C periodontitis and periodontal health and to understand the roles of these molecules in periodontal inflammation process and also to compare the three biomarkers ' discriminative efficacy in periodontal disease . METHODS : A total of 80 individuals , 20 with stage III grade A periodontitis ( group A ) , 20 with stage III grade B periodontitis ( group B ) , 20 with stage III grade C periodontitis ( group C ) and 20 with healthy periodontium ( group H ) were recruited for this study . Full mouth clinical periodontal measurements were recorded in periodontal charts . Whole saliva samples were collected to determine the levels of suPAR , HIF 1alpha and TNF alpha in study groups using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) method . RESULTS : The saliva concentration of suPAR , HIF 1alpha , and TNF alpha was significantly higher in group A , group B , and group C compared with group H ( p < . 05 ) . Additionally , salivary suPAR concentration was significantly higher in group C than in groups A and B ( p < . 05 ) . Positive statistically significant correlations were observed between three biomarkers and all clinical parameters ( p < . 05 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Increased levels of saliva suPAR , HIF 1alpha , and TNF alpha suggest that these molecules may play a role in periodontitis . In addition , the higher salivary suPAR levels in grade C periodontitis compared to other grades suggest that suPAR may be one of the potential molecules that can be used to predict disease progression and periodontal disease classification . TRIAL REGISTRATION : Before starting the study , the study plan was uploaded to clinicaltrials . gov . tr ​​and an identification number was obtained ( Date : 2024 , Identification number : NCT06430450 ) .
BACKGROUND : Lung adenocarcinoma ( LUAD ) is the most common subtype of lung cancer . Folic acid metabolism related genes ( FAMGs ) have received increased attention because of their distinct role in DNA synthesis and repair . Nevertheless , the function of FAMGs in LUAD remains ambiguous . METHODS : LUAD transcriptome data from GEO and TCGA were analyzed . Patients were classified into two clusters based on gene expression levels , revealing distinct overall survival ( OS ) outcomes . Common differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) were identified between LUAD and normal tissues , as well as between the two clusters . A prognostic risk model was established using Cox regression analysis to predict outcomes of LUAD patients and was validated with Kaplan Meier and ROC curve analysis . Clinical correlations and enrichment analyses were carried out to explore the functions of DEGs and their associations with clinical characteristics of LUAD patients . The tumor microenvironment and drug sensitivity were evaluated between two risk subgroups . Moreover , expression levels of prognostic genes were validated across datasets using the Wilcoxon test . RESULTS : The study identified seventy seven common DEGs and nine prognostic genes ( ANLN , PLK1 , DLGAP5 , PRC1 , CYP4B1 , MKI67 , KIF23 , BIRC5 , TK1 ) . The risk model could effectively predict the prognosis of LUAD patients . Clinical correlation analysis revealed that age , pathologic T , pathologic N , and tumor stage were significantly correlated with the risk score . Enrichment analysis showed that DEGs between the two risk subgroups were predominantly enriched in cell cycle and cellular senescence pathways . Differences in immune cell infiltration and immunotherapy markers were markedly noted between the two risk subgroups . Drug sensitivity analysis disclosed significantly diverse responses to sixty eight drugs between the two risk subgroups . Consistent expression tendencies of prognostic genes were observed across datasets . CONCLUSION : The prognostic model based on FAMGs demonstrates considerable potential for guiding diagnosis and clinical management of LUAD patients .
BACKGROUND : Plants and microorganisms are at the forefront of natural exploitable bioresources for the discovery of novel bioactive compounds ( BACs ) to provide solutions to food and agricultural challenges . The present study aimed to produce a novel biotechnologically relevant BAC from a mangrove sediment bacterium under optimized bioprocess medium conditions . The BAC producing bacteria were isolated via the crowded plate technique , and medium optimization was performed via sequential statistics of response surface methodology ( RSM ) . The RSM model predictions were optimized , validated , and scaled up in a 5 L bioreactor via submerged batch fermentation . The BAC was extracted with ethyl acetate , purified via silica gel column chromatography , and identified via semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography using bioactive standards with known retention times . The biocontrol , antioxidant and biopreservation potential of the BAC were evaluated via standard methods . RESULTS : The results revealed that strain GKRMS A9 produced the largest inhibition zone diameter ( ZND ) of 17 mm against the susceptible mould . The bacterium and its susceptible mould were identified as Lysinibacillus macroides and Aspergillus austroafricanus strains , respectively . Bioprocess medium optimization produced 6 g L ( 1 ) of the BAC with a ZND of 1 mm using 84% [v v ( 1 ) ] rice processing effluent , 58 gL ( 1 ) casamino acid , 39 g L ( 1 ) MgSO . 7HO , 78 g L ( 1 ) CaCl . 2HO , 94% [v v ( 1 ) ] inoculum volume , and 45 g L ( 1 ) NaHPO/NaHPO . The BAC concentration increased 7 fold in response to biological induction with susceptible mould . Silica gel chromatography revealed 9 bioactive fractions in the ethyl acetate extract , with fraction C ( retention time of 02 min ) eliciting the largest mean ZND of 1 +/ 7 mm against Aspergillus austroafricanus . Fraction C was identified as a heterocycloanthracin like class II bacteriocin with a molecular weight of 5 kDa . CONCLUSION : The bacteriocin ' macroidin ' is stable over a wide range of pH values and temperatures and has significant antimicrobial activity against Gram positive food borne and phytopathogenic strains of bacteria and moulds . Its antioxidant activities against DPPH and ABTS* ( + ) radicals are comparable to those of ascorbic acid , making this biomolecule a promising agent for biopreservation and phytopathogen control applications in the food and agricultural sectors .
BACKGROUND : Non Invasive Prenatal Testing ( NIPT ) is a technique that allows pregnant women to screen for chromosomal abnormalities in their developing fetus without the need for invasive procedures like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling . However , current methods to detect anomaly from maternal cell free DNAs ( cfDNAs ) that are based on the sequence read counts calculating z scores face challenges with false positives and negatives . To address these challenges , we aimed to develop a novel NIPT algorithm named KF NIPT , which is derived from the initials of k mer and fetal fraction used in its development with the goal of significantly improving accuracy . RESULTS : We developed a KF NIPT , a new algorithm that estimate chromosomal anomaly by calculating K mer based sequence depth and fetal fraction from the whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) data . Moreover , we implemented a modified preprocessing pipeline for the WGS data , correcting the biases of the genomic mapping quality and the GC contents . The performance of our method was evaluated using publicly available NIPT data . We could demonstrate that our method has better accuracy and sensitivity compared to those of the previous methods . CONCLUSIONS : We found that using k mer and fetal fraction reduces errors in NIPT and have integrated this into a pipeline , showing that the traditional read count based z score method can be improved . KF NIPT is implemented in the R and Python environment . The source code is available at https : //github . com/eastbrain/KF NIPT . KF NIPT has been tested on Ubuntu Linux 64 server and Linux 64 on Windows using a WSL ( Windows Subsystem for Linux ) .
Ferroptosis is a novel iron dependent type of programmed cell death that is characterized by the oxidation of lipids by divalent iron ions to produce lipid peroxides , which leads to cell death . Fucosyltransferase 11 ( FUT11 ) is highly expressed in most tumors and is involved in tumorigenesis . However , there have been few studies regarding the relationship between FUT11 and ferroptosis . In this study , we found that FUT11 expression was abnormally high in gastric cancer ( GC ) cells and that the prognosis of patients with GC and high expression of FUT11 was poor . FUT11 expression was significantly correlated with the TNM stage of GC . Specific knockdown of FUT11 significantly inhibited the proliferation of GC cells , reduced the abundance of the key anti ferroptotic protein glutathione peroxidase 4 ( GPX4 ) , induced lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in GC cells , and inhibited the proliferation of these cells . The overexpression of GPX4 reduced the inhibitory effect of FUT11 on GC cells . In addition , the knockdown of FUT11 significantly inhibited GC tumor growth in mice , and this inhibitory effect was reduced by the overexpression of GPX In conclusion , we have shown that FUT11 promotes GC progression by targeting GPX4 , thereby inhibiting ferroptosis in GC cells . These findings suggest that FUT11 is a potential therapeutic target for GC .
BACKGROUND : Nocturnal desaturation is occasionally observed in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) despite the absence of parenchymal lung disease ; however , the underlying mechanism remains unclear . This study aimed to clarify the clinical features of nocturnal desaturation in patients with CTEPH . METHODS : Data of 163 patients with CTEPH who underwent balloon pulmonary angioplasty ( BPA ) between March 2011 and December 2022 were retrospectively analyzed . We evaluated their hemodynamics using right heart catheterization , arterial blood gas examination , respiratory function tests , nocturnal oximetry , and cardiopulmonary exercise testing , which were routinely performed at baseline and after BPA . RESULTS : A higher ratio of dead space to tidal volume ( VD/VT ) ( p < 001 ) and higher alveolar arterial oxygen difference ( A aDO2 ) ( p = 026 ) at baseline were associated with greater nocturnal desaturation in the multivariable linear analysis . After BPA , nearly normal hemodynamics was achieved ( mean pulmonary arterial pressure : 5 +/ 0 to 2 +/ 9 mmHg , p < 01 ) . Nocturnal desaturation also improved from 3 +/ 8% at baseline to 3 +/ 4% after BPA ( p < 01 ) . Improvement in VD/VT correlated well with improvement in nocturnal desaturation after BPA ( p < 001 , R linear = 18 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Nocturnal desaturation often coexists with CTEPH . VD/VT , a marker of physiologic dead space fraction , A aDO2 , a marker of ventilation perfusion mismatch , and lung diffusing capacity were strongly associated . Nocturnal desaturation improved slightly after BPA , which was associated with a decrease in the physiological dead space fraction . Our study emphasizes the importance of including nocturnal oximetry in routine evaluations and continuation of nocturnal oxygen therapy , if necessary , in patients with CTEPH .
BACKGROUND : Metabolic syndrome significantly contributes to mortality among individuals suffering from chronic schizophrenia ( CS ) , and there is a strong correlation between this condition and plasma leptin ( LEP ) levels . However , there are relatively few studies on the factors affecting leptin levels in chronic schizophrenia , and findings are often inconsistent . The purpose of this study was to investigate the leptin levels and their association with psychopathology , BDNF and inflammatory cytokines in patients with chronic schizophrenia , as well as potential gender differences . METHODS : The study enrolled 301 individuals diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia . Participants were assessed for psychotic symptoms , insomnia severity , and depressive symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) , Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) , and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia ( CDSS ) , respectively . Leptin , BDNF and inflammatory cytokines levels were also detected . RESULTS : Among the patients , Log LEP levels were positively correlated with females , body mass index ( BMI ) , systolic and diastolic blood pressures , Log BDNF , Log IL 6 , and Log IL 17 A levels , and negatively correlated with the total score on the PANSS , as well as scores on the positive , negative , and general psychopathology subscales ( all p < 05 ) . Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that Log LEP levels were independently correlated with gender ( beta = 514 , t = 601 , p < 001 ) , BMI ( beta = 053 , t = 096 , p < 001 ) , diastolic blood pressure ( beta = 005 , t = 334 , p = 020 ) , and Log IL 17 A levels ( beta = 062 , t = 097 , p = 037 ) . Notably , these associations between leptin and the above factors were only observed in the male patients . CONCLUSIONS : A significant link was identified between leptin levels and the presence of psychotic symptoms , BDNF , and inflammatory cytokines ( especially IL 6 and IL 17 A ) in individuals suffering from chronic schizophrenia , with notable variations observed between genders . Future research , including more longitudinal studies and animal models , is necessary to delve deeper into these associations and uncover their underlying mechanisms .
BACKGROUND : Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness , the pharmacological treatment of which comprises primarily the use of antipsychotics . However , non adherence to their use and its reliable determination present a serious clinical and economic problem . This study aimed to determine therapeutic adherence in outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders by combining short term electronic monitoring of dispenser opening with the measurement of antipsychotic blood concentrations . METHODS : A total of 55 patients underwent a week long electronic monitoring of dispenser opening and measurement of blood concentrations before and after monitoring . Patients who correctly opened the dispenser at least in 80% of scheduled time points during the weekly interval and , at the same time , did not show a change in blood concentration of the antipsychotic by more than 30% in any direction , were considered adherent . RESULTS : 1% of the patients met the adherence criteria , which was less than that determined by the Drug Attitude Inventory ( DAI 10 ) , the Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , and the Clinician Rating Scale ( CRS ) . 3% of the patients took less than 80% of the prescribed doses and a change in blood concentrations of the antipsychotic by more than 30% was detected in 4% of the patients . In 9% of patients , the detected concentrations were within the recommended therapeutic reference interval . The groups of adherent and non adherent patients did not differ statistically significantly in the severity of their illness as determined by the Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) , the Personal and Social Performance scale ( PSP ) , and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) . CONCLUSIONS : The combined method of evaluating adherence in schizophrenia patients confirmed the results determined by other methods . The benefits of this approach are described in the paper .
BACKGROUND : Pyrus ussuriensis Maxim . are rich in nutrients , with a pleasant aroma and postharvest softening properties . Postharvest softening influences shelf life of fruit and fruit quality . Melatonin is a natural and safe preservative , which can effectively maintain fruit quality after harvesting , and delay softening of fruit . The aim of study was to elucidate mechanism of pear fruit softening and fruit aroma during postharvest storage and effect of melatonin . RESULTS : Ethylene production rate , respiration rate , weight loss of fruit , soluble solid content , titratable acidity were assessed , and transmission electron microscopy , metabolite profiling , and whole transcriptome RNA sequencing were performed . Four important pathways that pentose and glucuronate interconversion , galactose metabolism , sphingolipid metabolism and the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway were involved in pear fruit softening . Ethylene production pathway related genes , such as ACS and ACO were involved in pear fruit softening and expression of that under exogenous melatonin treatment were slightly inhibited . Fruit aroma changed after storage mainly through lipoxygenase pathway under ddHO treatment and exogenous melatonin treatment changed composition of volatile organic compounds . CeRNA networks associated with pear softening and aroma were established . Mdm miR159a , mdm miR396a/b p3 and mdm miR408a were found to modulate both fruit softening and aroma formation through ceRNA analysis . Mdm miR10988 p3 was functionally diverse and as major regulatory components in ceRNA network . CONCLUSIONS : This study indicated that degradation of cell wall caused pear fruit softening , lipoxygenase pathway mainly affected change of fruit aroma during postharvest storage and exogenous melatonin treatment could improve fruit firmness after storage and alter pear ' s aroma . The mechanism underlying these effects was elucidated , providing theoretical basis for study of pear fruit softening and preservation technology .
This study aimed to optimize the fermentation conditions and medium composition for maximum acetylcholine ( ACh ) and biomass production by Lactiplantibacillus plantarum AM2 using the Taguchi array design , which enables efficient identification of influential variables through minimal experimental runs . Seven key factors were evaluated : beef extract , peptone , yeast extract , glucose , pH , agitation rate , and inoculation size . The optimization process identified the most significant variables influencing ACh and biomass production , with beef extract and peptone being critical for ACh synthesis , while inoculation size was a critical determinant of biomass yield . The optimal conditions for ACh production were determined as beef extract ( 11 g/l ) , peptone ( 40 g/l ) , yeast extract ( 5 g/l ) , glucose ( 20 g/l ) , pH 7 , no agitation , and 1% ( v/v ) inoculation size , resulting in a predicted ACh concentration of 83 pg/ml and an experimental value of 8 pg/ml . For biomass production , the optimal conditions were beef extract ( 8 g/l ) , peptone ( 10 g/l ) , yeast extract ( 20 g/l ) , glucose ( 35 g/l ) , pH 6 , agitation at 150 rpm , and 4% ( v/v ) inoculation size , yielding a predicted biomass of 58 g/l and an experimental value of 3 g/l . The optimized conditions significantly improved ACh production ( 32 fold ) and biomass production ( 56 fold ) compared to basal conditions . These findings highlight the efficiency of the Taguchi approach in enhancing the production of ACh and biomass , providing insights into the functional niche of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum AM2 for potential industrial applications and its use in a symbiotic form .
Sepsis induced acute kidney injury ( S AKI ) is a life threatening complication of sepsis , marked by dysregulated inflammation , metabolic derangements , and immune dysfunction , driving high mortality . Its multifactorial pathogenesis increasingly implicates DNA methylation a core epigenetic mechanism as a critical disease modulator . This review synthesizes current knowledge of DNA methylation in S AKI , covering molecular mechanisms , cellular dysfunction , and translational potential . In immune cells , sepsis induced aberrant DNA methylation promotes hypomethylation of pro inflammatory genes and hypermethylation of anti inflammatory loci , exacerbating cytokine storms and immunosuppression . In renal tubular epithelial cells , abnormal methylation disrupts apoptosis , oxidative stress responses , and mitochondrial bioenergetics , impairing repair and accelerating S AKI progression . Renal vascular endothelial cells exhibit methylation dependent dysregulation of vasoactive and inflammatory pathways , compromising microvascular homeostasis and renal hemodynamics . DNA methylation signatures offer promise as early S AKI biomarkers , with cell type specific patterns reflecting severity , injury , and prognosis . Targeting DNA methyltransferases with epigenetic modifiers represents a novel therapy , though challenges arise from sepsis ' s complex epigenetic landscape bidirectional methylation changes , histone crosstalk , and context dependent responses . A key paradox lies in DNA methylation ' s dual traits : stability underpinning biomarker reliability and plasticity enabling dynamic inflammatory adaptation , yet introducing therapeutic heterogeneity . Future research should prioritize dissecting cell specific methylation mechanisms , integrating multi omics to identify epigenetic subnetworks , and developing real time monitoring tools for precision diagnosis and tailored interventions . Advancing these frontiers may translate epigenetic insights into transformative strategies to improve outcomes for this devastating condition .
The microbiome plays a critical role in poultry health and productivity , influencing growth , immunity , and the overall farm ecosystem . This study investigated microbial diversity , antibiotic resistance pathways , and functional potential across various components of poultry ecosystems cloacal swabs , droppings , feed , hand swabs , soil , and water in different districts of Bangladesh . Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing , we identified 2 , 745 Operational Taxonomic Units ( OTUs ) and analyzed microbial richness , community structure , and functional pathways . Alpha diversity metrics revealed that droppings exhibited the highest microbial richness ( 726 OTUs in Noakhali ) , while feed samples showed the lowest diversity ( 211 OTUs ) . Beta diversity analysis indicated significant differences in microbial composition across sample sources , with PERMANOVA confirming that sample origin accounted for 45% of the variability ( p < 001 ) . Proteobacteria dominated the microbial communities ( 36% ) , followed by Firmicutes ( 83% ) and Cyanobacteria ( 02% ) . Key genera of concern , such as Enterobacter ( 62% in hand swabs ) , Acinetobacter ( 87% in cloacal swabs ) , and Shigella ( 89% in cloacal swabs ) , were identified , highlighting potential contamination and zoonotic risks . Conversely , beneficial genera like Lactobacillus ( 89% in feed ) and Enterococcus ( 78% in droppings ) were prevalent , suggesting roles in gut health and nutrient cycling . Functional pathway analysis ( KEGG ) revealed that carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism were highly active in droppings and feed , reflecting nutrient utilization . Antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) pathways , such as 23S rRNA methyltransferase and multidrug efflux pumps , were widespread , with pathogenic genera ( Enterobacter , Acinetobacter , Shigella , Pseudomonas ) showing strong positive correlations with AMR pathways . These findings underscore the influence of environmental factors on microbial diversity and functional potential in poultry farming . The study highlights the need for improved management practices and biosecurity measures to mitigate risks associated with microbial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance , ultimately supporting healthier and more sustainable poultry production in Bangladesh .
BACKGROUND : RING type E3 ligases are critical regulators of diverse plant processes , yet their roles in maize remain poorly defined , particularly in drought responses . To address this knowledge gap , we conducted an integrative analysis of maize RING genes , combining evolutionary profiling , and candidate gene association studies to identify drought associated candidates . Key genes were further characterized via quantitative expression profiling , subcellular localization , in vitro ubiquitination assay , and functional validation in transgenic Arabidopsis . This study aimed to provide new insights into the maize RING gene family ' s role in drought stress adaptation . RESULTS : We employed three distinct methods and identified a total of 590 proteins . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these proteins could be grouped into 11 separate clusters . Our findings suggested that the expansion of the RING family in maize was likely due to gene duplication events . Notably , genetic variations in ZmRING 93 were significantly associated with drought tolerance , and its expression was up regulated under various abiotic stress conditions and hormone treatments . We further discovered that ZmRING 93 was a functional ubiquitin E3 ligase that localized to the nucleus , cytoplasm , and parts of the endoplasmic reticulum . Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing ZmRING 93 exhibited enhanced drought tolerance , with a lower water loss rate , further supporting the importance of ZmRING 93 in drought tolerance . CONCLUSIONS : These findings revealed that ZmRING 93 contributed to drought tolerance in maize and provided a basis for further investigation of the role of RING domain containing proteins .
PURPOSE : To investigate the clinical indicators that can predict myocardial damage in children with mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia ( MPP ) to help early identification and management . METHODS : The clinical data of 123 MPP children admitted from December 2023 to February 2024 in the affiliated Changzhou Children ' s Hospital of Nantong University were analyzed retrospectively . According to the creatine kinase isoenzyme ( CK MB ) level , the children were divided into 61 cases without myocardial damage group and 62 cases with myocardial damage group . Clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters were compared between the two groups . The factors affecting myocardial damage in children with MPP were analyzed by logistic regression . The ROC curve analyzed the predictive value of relevant indicators for myocardial damage in children with MPP . RESULTS : The incidence of abnormal electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , extrapulmonary manifestations ( except myocardial damage ) , white blood cell count ( WBC ) , neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , albumin and other myocardial enzyme parameters in the myocardial damage group were higher than those in the group without myocardial damage ( P < 05 ) , and the median age and platelet/neutrophil ratio ( PNR ) were lower than those in the group without myocardial damage ( P < 05 ) ; there was no significant difference in general data such as gender , duration of fever , length of hospital stay , the incidence of severe pneumonia between the two groups ( P > 05 ) ; multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that median age , NLR level and extrapulmonary manifestations ( except myocardial damage ) were the main factors affecting myocardial damage in children with MPP ( P < 05 ) ; considering the interaction between NLR and PNR . We also performed ROC curve analysis for PNR . Among the univariate factors , PNR had the highest predictive value , and the specificity was as high as 9% . The combined area under the curve of the four indicators was 747 , higher than that of the univariate factor ( P < 001 ) , with a predictive sensitivity of 9% and a specificity of 9% . CONCLUSION : Children with MPP younger than 79 years have extrapulmonary manifestations ( acute sinusitis , acute otitis media , etc . ) , NLR > 41 , and PNR < 74 in blood routine are more likely to develop myocardial damage . CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER : Not applicable .
BACKGROUND : Multidrug resistant ( MDR ) Gram negative bacteria pose a significant challenge due to their limited treatment options . The production of extended spectrum beta lactamases ( ESBLs ) is an important mechanism of resistance . This study aimed to identify the incidence and characteristics of ESBL encoding genes ( bla ( CTX M ) , bla ( TEM ) , bla ( SHV ) , and bla ( OXA ) ) in MDR isolates . MATERIALS AND METHODS : A cross sectional study was conducted from September 2022 to May ESBL producing isolates ( n = 105 ) out of 412 were recovered from hospitalized and outpatient settings and analyzed . Standard microbiological methods were used for isolates identification , susceptibility testing , and phenotypic ESBL detection . Additionally , bla ( CTX M ) , bla ( TEM ) , bla ( SHV ) , and bla ( OXA ) genes were identified using conventional PCR . RESULTS : Molecular profiling of beta lactamase determinants was conducted via PCR targeting bla ( CTX M ) , bla ( TEM ) , bla ( SHV ) , and bla ( OXA ) genes . Among phenotypically confirmed ( 100% ) ESBL producers , 98% harbored one or more target genes , with bla ( CTX M ) predominant ( 81% ) , followed by bla ( SHV ) ( 4% ) , bla ( TEM ) ( 62% ) , and bla ( OXA ) ( 4% ) . Carbapenem resistance was higher in ESBL producing strains compared to non ESBL strains . Extensively drug resistant ( XDR ) isolates were the most common across hospital departments and outpatients . DISCUSSION : This study highlights the significant prevalence of ESBL genes and multidrug resistance among Gram negative bacteria . The dominance of bla ( CTX M ) and the existence of multiple resistance genes raise concerns about limited treatment options . The findings emphasize the need for stricter antibiotic stewardship and infection control measures to curb the spread of MDR pathogens . CONCLUSION : This study provides valuable insights into the alarming incidence of ESBL genes and MDR in Mansoura , Egypt . Continuous surveillance and implementation of effective control strategies are crucial to combat this growing public health threat .
BACKGROUND : Cardamine hupingshanensis is a plant known for its unique selenium tolerance , making it a key model for selenium metabolism research . Adenosine phosphosulfate kinase ( APK ) and adenosine phosphosulfate reductase ( APR ) are widely distributed in plants and play a crucial role in selenium metabolism . While genome wide analyses of the APK and APR families have been conducted across various plant species , a systematic identification and analysis of these gene families in Cardamine hupingshanensis is still lacking . RESULTS : There are 7 ChAPK and 5 ChAPR genes identified from the genome of C . hupingshanensis , which can be classified into 4 subfamilies for ChAPK and 3 subfamilies for ChAPR , respectively . All these members share similar conserved motifs and gene structures . Phylogenetic and promoter analyses suggest they are involved in environmental responses , phytohormone regulation , and light signalling . Molecular docking analysis indicated that ChAPK enzymes have a higher affinity for adenosine phosphoselenate ( APSe ) compared to ChAPR . In 3D interaction force analysis , residues such as His , Asp and Arg were found to interact with the substrate APSe in ChAPK . For ChAPR , residues such as Gly , Arg and Leu were primarily involved in the catalytic site . Leaf cells of C . hupingshanensis exhibited a reduced state under 1 microg Se L ( 1 ) selenite concentration , but showed an oxidative state at 100 microg Se L ( 1 ) , as indicated by antioxidant enzyme activities and metabolite assays . The gene expression level of ChAPK2 1 and ChAPR2 increased by 2 and 1 folds , respectively , in the reduced state of plant cells , with smaller increases in the oxidative state , ChAPK2 1 increased by only 5 fold and ChAPR2 by 2 fold . CONCLUSIONS : All members of ChAPK and ChAPR families have a strong affinity for APSe and are regulated by the redox state . However , only three members of ChAPK ( ChAPK1 1 , ChAPK1 2 , and ChAPK4 2 ) are regulated by the redox state , and these are located in the chloroplast . Furthermore , low concentrations of selenium in the nutrient solution can promote antioxidant activity in the leaves of C . hupingshanensis seedlings , whereas high concentrations of selenium exhibit the opposite effect , as confirmed by the results of oxidative metabolite and antioxidant enzyme assays .
Parkinson ' s Disease ( PD ) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the depletion of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra , leading to hallmark motor symptoms such as bradykinesia , tremor , and rigidity . While the focus of PD has been on motor changes , dermatological changes are also commonly seen and may even precede the neurological symptoms . Individuals with PD may exhibit impaired wound healing , potentially due to dysregulated mechanisms involving epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and N methyl D aspartate ( NMDA ) in keratinocytes . This paper hypothesizes that the potential for impaired wound healing in PD patients is linked to reduced EGFR activity and altered NMDAR subunit expression in keratinocytes , in contrast to the upregulated wound healing seen in conditions like psoriasis , which demonstrates elevated EGFR and changes in NMDAR subunit activity . Furthermore , a potential co interaction between EGF and NMDA in keratinocytes may further contribute to impaired wound healing . Investigating these signaling mechanisms can improve understanding and management of associated dermatological symptoms . We propose additional studies to quantify differences in rates of wound healing between PD patients and age matched controls in effort to explore therapeutic targets for enhancing wounding healing in the context of PD .

BACKGROUND : Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) in pediatric patients has been linked to unfavorable short term and long term health outcomes . Despite the significance of AKI awareness in children with diabetes mellitus type 1 ( T1D ) , the incidence of AKI in children admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) has been under looked . OBJECTIVES : The primary objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of acute kidney injury ( AKI ) in pediatric patients hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) , and to identify the clinical and biochemical markers associated with the development of AKI . METHODS : A retrospective medical record review was conducted at King Abdulaziz University Hospital , a tertiary hospital in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia . The study included 373 children aged 18 years or younger from 2012 to 2022 with complete medical records available for analysis . We collected baseline and diabetes characteristics , in addition to clinical variables at presentation . Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) was diagnosed using the serum creatinine criteria established by the kidney disease : Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) organization . Descriptive comparisons were performed . Uni and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to identify potential risk factors associated with the development of AKI . RESULTS : 299 patients ( 2% ) developed AKI including 98 ( 3% ) stage 1 , and 118 ( 6% ) stage 2 and 83 ( 3% ) stage The frequency of AKI was higher in patients with severe DKA ( 9% vs . 7% , p=01 ) while in mild DKA the percentage of AKI was less than non AKI ( 9% vs . 1% , p<01The median last HbA1C prior to DKA presentation was 12% , and majority ( 2% ) had DKA episodes in past . children who developed AKI had a significantly higher median heart rate ( 120 bpm , IQR 104 138 ) compared to those without AKI ( 108 bpm , IQR 98 124 , p<01 ) . A high percentage of children with AKI had low Glasgow coma scale ( <15 ) compared to non AKI ( 7% vs . 7% ) but the difference was not statistically significant ( p=22 ) . Half of the children presented with DKA had poor outpatient follow up visits . The proven infections were observed in 53 ( 2% ) children in DKA . It was higher in non AKI group compared to AKI group ( 1% vs . 8% , p=46 ) . At the time of discharge 131 ( 44% ) patients with AKI showed persistent acute kidney disease . We did not observe mortality . Children with AKI had longer hospital stay compared to non AKI ( 4 days vs . 3 days , p=02 ) . None of the study participant have died during the studied hospital encounters . CONCLUSION : Our findings indicate that AKI is common in children admitted with DKA . Longer duration and poor controlled T1D ; previous episodes of DKA , severe DKA , infection and higher heart rate are risk factors to develop AKI . At the time of discharge , 131 ( 44% ) patients AKI showed persistent acute kidney disease ( AKD ) . The longer hospital stay in children with AKI highlights the significant morbidity of AKI .

OBJECTIVE : The study mainly aim at exploring the ascites risk factors among decompensated cirrhosis patients via constructing the prediction model of ascites incidence . METHODS : Here , we recruited 148 decompensated cirrhosis patients for analysis , their laboratory tests and complications recorded . T test , chi square test , single factor logistic regression , multi factor logistic regression , and nomogram model were used to investigate the ascites occurred factors in decompensated cirrhosis patients with ascites . To validate the data analysis results , we applied the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve , calibration curve , and decision curve analysis ( DCA ) to evaluate the discrimination , calibration , and clinical usefulness of the prediction model , respectively . RESULTS : Serum creatinine levels were higher in the cirrhotic ascites group than in the non ascites group . The ascites group had lower albumin and serum sodium levels , as well as a lower incidence of variceal bleeding and varicose veins compared to the non ascites group . CONCLUSION : Varicose veins , variceal bleeding , and serum sodium levels are significant factors contributing to ascites development in cirrhosis . Furthermore , decreased serum albumin and elevated creatinine levels are important indicators of poor prognosis . Nomograms can improve clinicians ' informed decision making for patients with decompensated cirrhosis , ultimately reducing ascites risk .
BACKGROUND : The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in host health . Recent study revealed that ubiquitin specific protease 25 ( USP25 ) deficiency affected colonic immune responses and resistance to certain bacterial infection . This study aimed to investigate the impact of USP25 gene deletion on the gut microbiota of mice , utilizing 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing to provide a comprehensive analysis of microbial diversity , composition and functional characteristics . METHODS : We collected fecal samples from 10 wild type ( WT ) C57BL/6J mice and 10 USP25 ( / ) mice ( C57BL/6J Usp25 ( em1 ) cyagen ) for 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing . Subsequently , the 6 of the 20 samples underwent further analysis using metagenomic sequencing . RESULTS : Our results revealed significant differences in the gut microbiota between USP25 knockout ( KO ) mice and wild type ( WT ) controls , with KO mice exhibiting 1 , 858 unique amplicon sequence variants ( ASVs ) compared to 1 , 723 in WT mice . Notably , the KO group displayed a higher tendency for biofilm formation and a greater proportion of gram negative bacteria , while the WT group demonstrated enhanced stress tolerance and a higher presence of gram positive bacteria . Functional prediction analyses indicated an increase in antibiotic resistance genes in the KO mice , particularly for tetracycline , cephalosporin , and sulfonamides , suggesting a potential risk for clinical antibiotic treatment efficacy . Moreover , KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment for fructose and mannose metabolism , streptomycin biosynthesis in the KO group . Furthermore , an increase in protective microbes alongside a decrease in potential pathogens in the KO microbiota hinted at altered immune responses due to USP25 deletion . CONCLUSION : Our findings elucidate the essential role of USP25 in modulating gut microbiota composition and function , providing insights for future therapeutic strategies targeting gut microbiota in disease contexts . CLINICAL TRAIL NUMBER : Not applicable .
BACKGROUND : Vitamin D is critical in overall health , particularly during pregnancy , as it supports a healthy pregnancy and promotes proper fetal development . This study examined the link between parental 25 hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) deficiency and their offspring ' s anthropometric and biological parameters . METHODS : A cross sectional study was conducted involving 50 Algerian families , which included 50 pregnant women in their third trimester , 50 fathers , and 50 newborns . Blood samples were collected from both parents and the umbilical cord of the newborns . Serum 25 ( OH ) D concentrations were measured , and demographic and health related information was gathered from the participants . The anthropometric parameters of the newborns were recorded at birth . RESULTS : In our study , 16% of women were insufficient in 25 ( OH ) D , 54% were deficient , and the remaining 30% exhibited severe deficiency , with mean 25 ( OH ) D levels of 53 ng/ml , 23 ng/ml , and 69 ng/ml , respectively . Among males , 40% were insufficient , 42% were deficient , and 18% had severe deficiency , with mean 25 ( OH ) D levels of 25 ng/ml , 78 ng/ml , and 53 ng/ml , respectively . Furthermore , 24% of newborns were insufficient , 52% were deficient , and 24% had severe deficiency , with mean 25 ( OH ) D levels of 53 ng/ml , 46 ng/ml , and 53 ng/ml , respectively . Maternal 25 ( OH ) D levels were positively correlated with the anthropometric parameters of newborns ( height , femur length , weight , and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min after birth ) . Conversely , paternal deficiency showed no correlation with these parameters . CONCLUSION : 25 ( OH ) D deficiency significantly impacts newborns and represents a significant risk to their development , whereas paternal deficiency has no impact on the measured anthropometric parameters of newborns .
Hormone receptor ( HR ) positive ( HR + ) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative ( aka HER2 ) breast cancer ( BC ) is the most frequently diagnosed subtype . Recent development of next generation endocrine therapies ( e . g . selective estrogen receptor degraders ( SERDs ) ; third generation aromatase inhibitors ( AI ) and targeted therapies ( e . g . , CDK4/6 , PI3K , and mTOR inhibitors ) ) as well as antibody drugs conjugates ( ADC , eg . T DXd and SG ) showed promising results with meaningful improvements in survival for patients with metastatic HR + HER2 BC . Therapy selection is mainly based on clinical , tumor pathological and molecular characteristics as well as on efficacy based on trial data , nevertheless , side effect profiles are key differentiators of treatments in the metastatic setting . Therefore , understanding how patients evaluate various treatment attributes and how these change in different clinical situations is fundamental toward the choice of optimal therapeutic strategies for treating metastatic HR + HER2 Stage IV patients . Here , we investigated treatment preferences of a total of 102 stage IV HR + HER2 breast cancer patients in Italy by developing and applying a survey instrument based on discrete choice experiment ( DCE ) . Treatment efficacy was the top valued attribute across all patient segments and the second most important attribute was the risk of grade >/= 3 adverse events ( AE ) . Overall , therapies with better outcomes of PFS or AE grade 3 or higher would have a higher impact on the preference to choose a treatment from a patient perspective .
Psoriasis is a significant global health challenge due to limited treatment efficacy . Paris saponin VII ( PSVII ) shows anti inflammatory and anti proliferative potential but its role in psoriasis is unclear . In this study , PSVII was identified from a library of natural compounds as a therapeutic candidate for psoriasis . In a murine model , PSVII reduced skin lesion severity , epidermal thickness , and inflammatory factor expression , preliminaryly indicating its anti inflammatory properties . In vitro , PSVII inhibited HaCaT cell hyperproliferation , regulated the cell cycle , induced apoptosis , and modulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Bioinformatics analyses suggested that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) , cysteine aspartate specific protease 1 ( Caspase 1 ) , and the process of pyroptosis are likely targets and mechanisms of PSVII action . PSVII could reduce cell mortality in psoriatic cells and lowered expression levels of NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 ( NLRP3 ) , Caspase 1 , Gasdermin D ( GSDMD ) , Interleukins ( IL ) 18 , and IL 1beta , underscoring its potential role in modulating pyroptosis within these cells . Mechanistically , PSVII may suppress the STAT3/nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) signaling pathway . Consequently , PSVII plays a significant role in psoriasis management . PSVII could modulate pyroptotic cell death in psoriatic cells by targeting the STAT3/NFkappaB signaling cascade , leading to anti inflammatory and anti proliferative effects , and thereby ameliorating psoriasis symptoms .
BACKGROUND : Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is a prevalent and highly malignant neoplasm on a global scale , ranking as the second most widespread cause of cancer associated death . Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) control tumorigenic processes in CRC by modulating inflammatory signals . However , the precise mechanisms remain unknown . METHODS : LncRNAs regulated by thioredoxin 1 ( Trx 1 ) and interleukin ( IL ) 6 were identified by RNA sequencing ( RNA seq ) . The effect of MIR3142HG on CRC growth , migration , and invasion was assessed through methods of cell counting kit 8 ( CCK 8 ) , colony formation assay , Transwell assay , and animal experimentation , respectively . The regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) on the MIR3142HG promoter was verified using chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) and dual luciferase reporter assays . The interaction of MIR3142HG with Trx 1 and STAT3 proteins was validated with RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation ( RIP ) and RNA pulldown experiments . Bioinformatics analysis and tissue microarray were utilized for evaluating the clinical value of MIR3142HG in CRC . RESULTS : We identified a lncRNA , MIR3142HG , regulated by Trx 1 knockdown and IL 6 treatment . Overexpression of MIR3142HG enhanced CRC cell proliferation , migration , and invasion , while its knockdown impaired these processes . STAT3 bound to the MIR3142HG promoter and activated its transcription . Upregulated MIR3142HG acted as a scaffold for the Trx 1/STAT3 complex to inhibit the degradation of Trx 1 and phosphorylated STAT3 ( p STAT3 ) . In situ hybridization ( ISH ) results of CRC tissues indicated that MIR3142HG expression was significantly elevated during the early stages of CRC . Moreover , consistent with the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) dataset , high MIR3142HG expression predicted better survival . CONCLUSIONS : Our study identified a novel lncRNA MIR3142HG , which interacts with STAT3 and Trx 1 to promote CRC progression , providing a possible diagnostic target for CRC .
OBJECTIVE : To explore the role of genes related to fatty acid metabolism in lung adenocarcinoma classification and prognosis . METHODS : Transcriptome and clinical data from the TCGA database and GEO database were collected , the expression of prognostic fatty acid metabolism related genes in LUAD patients was analyzed , and key genes related to both fatty acid metabolism and subtype were identified . These key genes were further filtered via the LASSO regression method , and the retained genes were used to construct a risk scoring model . The biological function of RPS4Y1 was verified by cell viability , colony formation , migration , and flow cytometry assays . Finally , immune infiltration and drug sensitivity were analyzed in the high and low risk groups . RESULTS : 31 key FAMGs associated with prognosis were identified in LUAD patients . LUAD cases were divided into 3 subtypes on the basis of the expression of these genes . The DEGs between the different subtypes were associated mainly with amino acid metabolic pathways . In addition , among the 46 DEGs between subtypes , 5 key FAMGs ( SCGB3 A2 , PGC , ADH7 , RPS4Y1 , and KRT6 A ) were identified as the best prognostic markers via LASSO regression to establish a risk scoring model . Patients with low risk scores had a better prognosis and a greater degree of immune cell infiltration than those with high risk scores . RPS4Y1 is highly expressed in LUAD , and its knockdown significantly inhibits the growth of tumor cells . Moreover , we also analyzed drugs likely to be effective for the high and low risk groups . CONCLUSION : FAMGs play important roles in LUAD , and the key genes identified may be new targets for LUAD treatment .
Perceptual and cognitive effort require the expenditure of brain energy , and the efficiency of that energy expenditure can vary as a function of a range of exogenous and endogenous factors . The same is true for physical work , and tools have been developed to quantify energetic efficiency in the performance of physical work . The same is not true for the study of perceptual and cognitive effort . Here we draw on two lines of research the formal characterization of workload capacity in perception and cognition , and the study of physical work to propose a novel measure of neurocognitive efficiency . This neurocognitive efficiency score ( NES ) combines reaction time data with measures on concurrently acquired electroencephalographic ( EEG ) data to form a ratio that can be interpreted in terms of work accomplished relative to energy expended . We consider three measures on the EEG and show that one of them global field power ( GFP ) evidences a strong relationship to measures of metabolic energy expended . We then show how the NES can provide insights into differences in perceptual performance as a function of biological state . We argue that the NES has the potential for a wide range of applications in the study of effort exerted in perception and cognition in the context of factors including ( but not limited to ) aging , disease , stress , and differences in levels of expertise .
Targeting gut microbiota is an innovative approach to mitigate the development of metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease associated hepatocellular carcinoma ( MASLD HCC ) . This study aims to investigate the effects of Prohep , a probiotic mixture , both as a prophylactic measure and as an adjuvant therapy for low dose sorafenib . A MASLD HCC mice model was established by diethylnitrosamine ( DEN ) injection with feeding of a high fat high cholesterol ( HFHC ) diet . Gut microbiome profiles were later identified through shotgun sequencing . Our findings demonstrated that Prohep supplementation effectively suppressed MASLD HCC development in mice . This protective effect was attributed to the modulation of gut microbiota and the increased production of short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) , propionate , and valerate . Prohep also activated AMPK , which decreased lipogenesis , reduced lipid uptake , and enhanced antioxidant enzyme expressions . Additionally , the cancer proliferation pathway PI3K/mTOR was inhibited in response to Prohep treatment . As an adjuvant therapy , Prohep improved the efficacy of low dose sorafenib , as indicated by reduced tumor counts , alleviated inflammation , and increased hepatic superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) expression . The combination led to enhanced butyrate production , contributing to the overall therapeutic effects , thanks to the gut microbiota modulatory effects of Prohep . These results underscore Prohep ' s anti tumorigenic properties and its potential to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of low dose sorafenib in MASLD HCC treatment . The study highlights the importance of gut microbiota modulation for developing effective neoadjuvant therapies and long term management strategies for MASLD HCC .
We demonstrate non immunogenic circRNA as a tool for targeted gene regulation in plants , where it acts in an isoform and sequence specific manner , enabling future agronomic applications . Circular RNAs ( circRNAs ) are single stranded RNA molecules characterized by their covalently closed structure and are emerging as key regulators of cellular processes in mammals , including gene expression , protein function and immune responses . Recent evidence suggests that circRNAs also play significant roles in plants , influencing development , nutrition , biotic stress resistance , and abiotic stress tolerance . However , the potential of circRNAs to modulate target protein abundance in plants remains largely unexplored . In this study , we investigated the potential of designer circRNAs to modulate target protein abundance in plants using Arabidopsis protoplasts as a model system . We show that PEG mediated transfection with a 50 nt circRNA ( GFP ) containing a 30 nt GFP antisense sequence results in a dose and sequence dependent reduction of GFP reporter target protein abundance . Notably , a single stranded open isoform of circRNA ( GFP ) had little effect on protein abundance , indicating the importance of the closed circular structure . Additionally , circRNA ( GFP ) also reduced GFP abundance in Arabidopsis mutants defective in RNA interference ( RNAi ) , suggesting that circRNA activity is independent of the RNAi pathway . We also show that circRNA , unlike dsRNA , does not induce pattern triggered immunity ( PTI ) in plants . Findings of this proof of principle study together are crucial first steps in understanding the potential of circRNAs as versatile tools for modulating gene expression and offer exciting prospects for their application in agronomy , particularly for enhancing crop traits through metabolic pathway manipulation .
Although alopecia areata ( AA ) is recognized as a hair loss disorder stemming from the dysregulation of cutaneous immune homeostasis , its precise pathogenesis still remains elusive . The collapse of hair follicle ( HF ) immune privilege ( IP ) , leading to immune cell mediated attack on the hair follicle , is currently the widely accepted fundamental mechanism of AA . Among the immune cells studied in this context , CD8 ( + ) T cells and regulatory T ( Treg ) cells are relatively well researched , but the direct involvement of macrophages in the disease process has been less frequently demonstrated . In this review , we summarize various previous studies on macrophages and hypothesize the immune mechanisms by which macrophages contribute to the pathogenesis of AA . This exploration provides new insights for future research and potential clinical treatments .
Elderly patients with lung dysfunction ( EPLD ) often experience chronic inflammation and impaired immune responses , significantly impacting their health outcomes . Currently , no specific treatment exists to prevent lung dysfunction in elderly patients . The detailed mechanism of lung dysfunction in elderly patients remains elusive , and this study aims to clarify it . General data and blood specimens were obtained from EPLD . A lung dysfunction mouse model was established by anesthetizing and ventilating BALB/c mice at a high tidal volume of 30 mL/kg . Blood samples and lung tissues were collected from all groups for further testing . HE staining , immunofluorescence , Western blot , ELISA , flow cytometry , and qRT PCR were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of multidimensional integrated lung protection measures ( MILPM ) in lung dysfunction mice by targeting the NF kappaB pathway . The results indicated that upregulation of the NF kappaB signaling pathway accelerates the lung dysfunction process , while downregulation of the NF kappaB signaling pathway can prevent it . Similarly , the upregulation of TNF alpha , IL 6 , IL 1beta , and ROS levels is associated with the lung dysfunction process , whereas reducing their levels can serve as a preventative method against lung dysfunction development . Upregulation of the NF kappaB pathway can accelerate the process of lung dysfunction .
Ethanol consumption is widely recognized for its detrimental effects on mental health , particularly its association with depressive disorders . This narrative review aims to explore the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying ethanol induced depression , synthesizing findings from preclinical and clinical studies . We begin by providing an overview of the relationship between chronic ethanol consumption and depression , highlighting compelling evidence from diverse populations . Subsequently , we delve into insights from animal models that elucidate the pathophysiological changes triggered by prolonged ethanol exposure . Key mechanisms identified include oxidative stress , which contributes to cellular damage ; neuroinflammation , characterized by the activation of glial cells and altered cytokine profiles ; and disruptions in neurotrophic factors that impair neuronal growth and survival . Furthermore , we discuss the induction of apoptosis in neural cells and the significant impact of ethanol on neurotransmitter receptor remodeling and regulation , leading to altered synaptic transmission . While substantial progress has been made in understanding these mechanisms , we also acknowledge the limitations of current research methodologies and call for further investigations to translate these findings into effective therapeutic strategies for individuals affected by ethanol induced depression . This review ultimately underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular underpinnings of ethanol ' s impact on mood disorders , paving the way for improved interventions and preventative measures .
Polysaccharides derived from Pleurotus eryngii possess various bioactive properties , including antioxidant , antidiabetic , anti inflammatory , and immunomodulatory effects . In this study , polysaccharides were extracted from P . eryngii fruiting bodies and exposed to gamma irradiation at doses of 50 and 100 kGy , with a dose rate of 5 kGy/h . The surface morphology of the polysaccharide irradiated at 100 kGy exhibited numerous pores and a smaller flake structure compared to those irradiated at 50 kGy and the non irradiated sample . H and C NMR spectra of all samples indicated that both irradiated and non irradiated polysaccharides exhibited alpha and beta configurations , with signals corresponding to C1 C5 clearly observed . HPLC analysis of the polysaccharides revealed that glucose ( 23% ) , galactose ( 96% ) , glucuronic acid ( 38% ) , ribose ( 94% ) , rhamnose ( 35% ) , and mannose ( 87% ) are the main components . All polysaccharides demonstrated antioxidant activity , which increased with concentration . Both non irradiated and irradiated polysaccharides exhibited antidiabetic effects , significantly reducing blood glucose levels , and restoring insulin level with superiority of irradiated polysaccharides . Additionally , they significantly elevated body weight , slightly reduced MDA levels , and markedly enhanced catalase activity in treated rats compared to diabetic controls . The antidiabetic effects of the polysaccharides were further confirmed by histopathological examination of the pancreas and liver sections from polysaccharide treated diabetic rats . This suggests that irradiation , by reducing the molecular weight of polysaccharides , enhances their bioavailability and efficacy in modulating glucose metabolism .
PvMLP19 overexpression in Arabidopsis enhances proline accumulation , mitigates oxidative stress , improves water retention , delays germination , and stimulates root growth under drought and salt stress conditions . Climate change has exacerbated the frequency and severity of drought and salinity stress , posing significant risks to agricultural productivity and food security . As sessile organisms , plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to adapt to these challenges . Common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L . ) , an essential legume crop valued for its high nutritional value , is increasingly impacted by climate change induced stressors . The PR10 protein family has been recognized as a potential contributor to enhancing plant resilience to abiotic and biotic stresses . This family , also known as Bet v1 , is highly conserved and consists of diverse subfamilies , including major latex proteins ( MLPs ) , which may contribute to stress tolerance through ligand binding and regulation of stress related pathways . This study aimed to investigate the functional role of PvMLP19 in stress tolerance using both in silico and experimental approaches . RNA seq analysis revealed tissue specific expression patterns of PR10s , with PvMLP19 showing notable induction under abiotic stress . Functional validation in transgenic Arabidopsis suggested that overexpression of PvMLP19 may improve drought tolerance . Transgenic plants exhibited increased proline accumulation , reduced oxidative stress , and higher relative water content under both drought and salinity stress conditions . Furthermore , PvMLP19 overexpression was associated with delayed seed germination but promoted root development under osmotic and salinity stress . The increased stress tolerance was linked to the upregulation of stress inducible genes , suggesting a potential regulatory role of PvMLP19 in modulating stress response pathways . These findings position PvMLP19 as a potential candidate for genetic improvement in crops , offering a promising strategy to mitigate the impacts of climate change and ensure sustainable agricultural productivity .
Metabolic rewiring is a hallmark of malignant transformation in leukemic cells and the potential offered by its therapeutic targeting has garnered significant attention . The development of clinically relevant metabolic targeted therapies in acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) has mostly focused on targeting mitochondrial energy production , but progress has been hampered by generalized toxicities . An alternative strategy is to shift the focus from targeting energy production to targeting more specialized metabolic functions , such as energy storage , the regulation of oxidative stress and availability of cofactors needed for the function of specific metabolic reactions . Lipid metabolism plays a role in many of these metabolic functions and its importance in AML maintenance and response to therapy is being increasingly recognized but needs to be adequately interpreted in the context of its interaction with the microenvironment , particularly the adipose niche . In this review , we provide an overview of our current understanding of AML cellular metabolic dependencies on fatty acid and lipid metabolism and discuss their relevance in the context of functional interactions with adipocytes . We highlight unresolved questions about how to best target lipid metabolism and suggest approaches needed to fully understand the interplay between malignant cells and their niche in the context of metabolic dependencies .
Graves ' orbitopathy ( GO ) affects 25 50% of patients with Graves ' disease . It progresses through phases , from active inflammation to fibrosis . Thyrotropin related antibodies ( TRAb ) and Insulin like growth factor ( IGF 1 ) contribute to GO ' s pathogenesis . Conventional treatments like glucocorticoids are often effective , but refractory cases require alternatives like rituximab ( RTX ) , tocilizumab ( TCZ ) , and teprotumumab ( TPM ) . These monoclonal antibodies show promise but carry significant risks . This review aims to assess their efficacy and safety . We retrieved relevant articles up to July 2024 from five databases . Data were extracted from eligible studies by two independent reviewers , including clinical activity scores 7 and 10 ( CAS ) , proptosis , antibody levels , and diplopia . All analyses were conducted using RevMan v In this review , we included 77 articles . Of these , 58 provided enough data for analysis . TPM , RTX , and TCZ all significantly reduced CAS 7 scores , with TCZ showing the most significant reduction ( 51 points , 95%CI : 25 , 78 ) , followed by TPM ( 1 points , 95%CI : 71 , 49 ) and RTX . Similarly , for CAS 10 , TCZ led with a 12 point reduction , significantly outperforming RTX ( P = 0006 ) . Proptosis decreased significantly with each drug , with TPM leading ( 95 mm ) , followed by TCZ ( 99 mm ) and RTX ( 79 mm ) . TRAb Levels : TCZ reduced TRAb levels by 29 U/L ( 95%CI : 48 , 09 ) , significantly more than RTX ( P = 03 ) . Complications varied , with TPM linked to hyperglycemia and ototoxicity , TCZ to hematologic and metabolic issues , and RTX to infusion related reactions . In conclusion , TCZ and TPM outperform RTX in treating GO , but TPM has higher complications , and RTX , though safer , shows more treatment failures .
The plasticity of living cell membranes relies on complex metabolic networks fueled by cellular energy . These metabolic processes exert direct control over membrane properties such as lipid composition and morphological plasticity , which are essential for cellular functions . Despite notable progress in the development of artificial systems mimicking natural membranes , the realization of synthetic membranes capable of sustaining metabolic cycles remains a challenge . Here we present an abiotic phospholipid metabolic network that generates and maintains dynamic artificial cell membranes . Chemical coupling agents drive the in situ synthesis of transiently stable non canonical phospholipids , leading to the formation and maintenance of phospholipid membranes . We find that phospholipid metabolic cycles can drive lipid self selection , favouring the enrichment of specific lipid species . Moreover , we demonstrate that controlling lipid metabolism can induce reversible membrane phase transitions , facilitating lipid mixing between distinct populations of artificial membranes . Our work demonstrates that a simple lipid metabolic network can drive dynamic behaviour in artificial membranes , offering insights into mechanisms for engineering functional synthetic compartments .
The neutralisation ability of homologous and heterologous booster vaccinations against the KP . 2 variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS CoV 2 ) is unknown . Therefore , we aimed to evaluate the neutralisation of the Omicron variants by comparing serum samples from Chinese individuals who received heterologous boosters ( from different manufacturers ) with those who received homologous boosters ( from the same manufacturer ) against SARS CoV We collected serum samples from participants in the homologous ( n = 38 ) and heterologous booster groups ( n = 38 ) over 690 days . Serum pseudo virus neutralisation was tested against the prototype , XBB . 1 , JN . 1 , and KP . 2 variants to detect neutralisation titres . An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the total concentration of neutralising antibodies against the receptor binding domain of SARS CoV Neutralisation assays revealed 3 , 3 , and 4 fold reductions against JN . 1 , KP . 2 , and XBB . 1 variants , respectively , compared with that against the prototype . However , no significant difference was observed in neutralising antibody titres among the JN . 1 , KP . 2 , and XBB . 1 Omicron variants . Additionally , homologous boosters and men produced fewer neutralising antibodies compared to heterologous boosters and women . Thus , our results demonstrate that the Omicron variant KP . 2 exhibits similar evasion properties to those observed in other variants .
Enzyme activation by cellular metabolites plays a pivotal role in regulating metabolic processes . Nevertheless , our comprehension of such activation events on a global network scale remains incomplete . In this study , we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the optimization of cell intrinsic activation interactions using Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic network as the basis of the analysis . To achieve this , we integrated a genome scale metabolic model with cross species enzyme kinetic data sourced from the BRENDA database , and to use this model as a basis to estimate the distribution of enzyme activators throughout the cellular network . Our findings indicate that the vast majority of biochemical pathways encompass enzyme activators , frequently originating from disparate pathways , thus revealing extensive regulatory crosstalk between metabolic pathways . Notably , activators have short pathway lengths , indicating they are activated quickly upon nutrient shifts , and in most instances , these activators target key enzymatic reactions to facilitate downstream metabolic processes . Interestingly , highly activated enzymes are substantially enriched with non essential enzymes compared to their essential counterparts . This observation suggests that cells employ enzyme activators to finely regulate secondary metabolic pathways that are only required under specific conditions . Conversely , the activator metabolites themselves are more likely to be essential components , and their activation levels surpass those of non essential activators . In summary , our study unveils the widespread importance of enzymatic activators and suggests that feed forward activation of conditional metabolic pathways through essential metabolites mediates metabolic plasticity .
Periprosthetic joint infection ( PJI ) is a critical complication following arthroplasty , leading to increased prosthesis failure rates post treatment . This study explores the role of PD 1/PD L1 signaling in osteoclastogenesis associated with PJI . Peripheral blood , bone , and bone marrow of 65 patients ( 20 primary osteoarthritis , 21 PJI septic explantation , 24 PJI prosthesis reimplantation ) were analyzed for their bone microstructure and cell composition . Immunocytochemistry , RT qPCR , flow cytometry , bone resorption assay , ELISA , and RNA sequencing were performed to investigate the effects of PD 1 stimulation and blockade on osteoclast formation . PD 1 positive monocytes and sPD L1 levels were elevated in PJI . Stimulation with PD L1 enhanced osteoclastogenesis , while PD 1 inhibitor nivolumab reversed these effects . Impact of PD 1 and nivolumab was significantly more pronounced in PJI compared to the control . Our study suggests PD 1/PD L1 signaling plays a significant role in PJI related osteoclastogenesis . These findings highlight the potential of PD 1 inhibitors as a novel approach to manage this challenging clinical condition .
This study examined the different effects of high fat and capsicum diets on the digestive organs of guinea pigs . Hartley guinea pigs ( n = 24 ) were divided into the high fat diet ( HFD ) , capsicum diet ( CD ) , and control ( C ) groups . Guinea pigs in the C , HFD , and CD groups received maintenance feed , high fat , and capsicum diets , respectively . After 12 weeks of modelling , serum samples were collected for biochemical analysis . Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify interleukin 1beta , interleukin 6 , and tumour necrosis factor alpha , while haematoxylin eosin staining was used to observe morphological changes . Blood lipid levels and inflammatory markers in the serum of guinea pigs in HFD and CD groups were significantly elevated than those in the serum of guinea pigs in the C group ( P < 01 ) . Inflammation and blood lipid disorders were more severe among guinea pigs in the HFD group than among those in the CD and C groups ( P < 001 ) . Pathological examinations revealed that high fat and capsicum diets induce damage to the liver , stomach , gallbladder , and colon . Specifically , high fat diets exhibited more significant effects . High fat or capsicum diet consumption can damage the digestive organs , causing abnormal lipid metabolism ; however , high fat diets exhibit more significant effects on the digestive organs .
Female infertility is a complex and multifactorial disease affecting millions of women worldwide , wherein oxidative stress and inflammation play major roles in its pathophysiology . Flavonoids , a class of polyphenolic compounds derived from plants , show promise in alleviating infertility related disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , endometriosis , and uterine implantation abnormalities . The antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties of flavonoids can be useful in overcoming oxidative damage and disturbances of inflammatory conditions within the reproductive system . Key flavonoids , including quercetin and apigenin , have demonstrated the ability to regulate hormonal imbalances , enhance follicular development , and improve oocyte quality . Flavonoids may also act by interacting with essential inflammatory and hormonal pathways to suppress the synthesis of pro inflammatory cytokines while increasing antioxidant defenses . The integration of flavonoid based strategies with conventional treatments opens up promising avenues in improving reproductive outcomes and advancing fertility therapies . This review will highlight the molecular mechanisms underlying the efficacy of flavonoids and point out their potential as nutraceutical interventions in the management of female infertility .
Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown that SARS CoV 2 infection is associated with new onset Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) . The overall goal of this study is to uncover how the COVID 19 severity gradient impacts the conventional pathological pathway of PD to inform the identification of at risk patients and the development of personalized treatment strategies . Transcriptomics analysis of 43 PD pathogenic genes was conducted on nasopharyngeal swabs from 50 COVID 19 patients with varying severity including 17 outpatients , 16 non ICU , and 17 ICU patients , compared to 13 SARS CoV 2 negative individuals . The study shows that COVID 19 severity gradient differentially dysregulates PD pathological genes . Dysfunctional lysosomal and mitochondrial processes in outpatients and non ICU COVID 19 patients was identified as the convergent network of COVID 19 PD interactions . These dysfunctions were later abrogated by the upregulation of the ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy lysosome system in ICU COVID 19 patients . A potential synergistic co expression and clustering of protein clearance pathway genes with other pathological genes was observed in ICU patients , indicating a possible overlap in biological pathways . Dysregulation of the PD pathopharmacogene , SLC6A3 was observed in ICU patients , suggesting potential COVID 19 gene drug interactions . Nasopharyngeal swabs express major PD pathological genes as well as clinically relevant drug processing genes , which could advance studies on PD , including diagnosis , pathogenesis , and the development of disease modifying treatments . Outpatients and non ICU COVID 19 patients may face a higher risk of developing new onset PD , whereas ICU COVID 19 patients may be more susceptible to COVID 19 gene drug interactions .
T cells are central to adaptive immunity , with proper thymic development and egress critical for T cell homeostasis in peripheral tissues . The molecular mechanisms governing thymic egress remain poorly understood . Here , we identify Rho GTPase activating protein 30 ( ARHGAP30 ) , predominantly expressed in lymphoid organs and previously uncharacterized in immunity , as a key regulator of thymocyte migration and egress . Loss of ARHGAP30 leads to impaired thymic development and severe T cell lymphopenia . Notably , Arhgap30 deficient mice exhibit a reduced number of immature single positive ( SP ) thymocytes but a normal number of mature SP thymocytes , indicating a blockade in thymic egress . Mechanistically , ARHGAP30 deficiency lowers GTP bound active RAC1 independent of its GAP activity , impairing actin polarization and thymocyte motility . ARHGAP30 selectively binds and stabilizes active RAC1 , preventing its proteasomal degradation via K48 linked ubiquitination . These findings establish ARHGAP30 as a critical checkpoint for thymic egress and underscore its essential role in maintaining peripheral T cell homeostasis .
NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron sulfur protein 3 ( NDUFS3 ) is the core subunit of the respiratory chain complex I ( CI ) . We found NDUFS3 were abnormally elevated in human melanoma and promoted melanoma proliferation . Furthermore , NDUFS3 could promote the oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) and the pentose phosphate pathway ( PPP ) , as well as attenuated glycolysis . As NDUFS3 mediated the metabolic changes of OXPHOS and glucose metabolism , melanoma cells produced more ATP , resulting in the inhibition of AMP kinase ( AMPK ) . AMPK induced phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase1 ( PRPS1 ) phosphorylation , which resulted in suppressed PRPS1 activity . Briefly , the NDUFS3 AMPK PRPS1 signaling axis coupled OXPHOS , glucose metabolism , and purine nucleotide biosynthesis to regulate melanoma proliferation . Our study highlighted an unrecognized role for NDUFS3 in melanoma , which might be used as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this type of cancer . NDUFS3 regulating PRPS1 activity through AMPK to affect melanoma proliferation .
Local calcium signals and formation of actin filaments help to steer and power neuronal morphology development and plasticity . Yet , responsible actin nucleators and their linkage to calcium transients largely remained elusive . Here , we identify the WH2 domain based actin nucleator JMY as target of the calcium sensor calmodulin , reveal that JMY is critical for dendritic arbor formation and unravel that JMY ' s molecular mechanisms employed in dendritic arborization are depended on Arp2/3 complex interaction , Arp2/3 complex activity and functionality of JMY ' s WH2 domains , i . e . on JMY ' s abilities to promote actin filament formation . We furthermore demonstrate that Ca ( 2+ ) /calmodulin association regulates the G actin loading of JMY ' s first WH2 domain . Consistently , JMY ' s functions in neuromorphogenesis rely on proper Ca ( 2+ ) /calmodulin signaling and on the first WH2 domain . These findings establish Ca ( 2+ ) /calmodulin signaling as an important , more widely used , but multifaceted mechanism of tight control of actin nucleators powering dendritic branch formation a key aspect in neuronal network development in the brain .
The gut microbiota of vertebrates significantly influences host physiology , yet little is known about how habitat factors shape microbiotas in non human species , especially freshwater turtles . This study explores the relationship between cloacal microbiota and serum metabolome in eastern longneck turtles ( Chelodina longicollis ) , marking the first such investigation in chelonians . By comparing microbiotas from two distinct pond environments , we applied a multi omics approach combining 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomic profiling . Results showed that location influenced microbial composition and metabolic profiles , with dominant bacterial phyla Pseudomonadota , Actinomycetota , and Bacillota , and distinct families linked to differences in microbial diversity . Notably , turtles from one pond displayed an unusually high proportion of Actinomycetota . We also found a clear connection between microbiota diversity and metabolome , suggesting certain bacterial combinations impact host physiology . These findings offer important insights into the complex interaction between microbial communities and metabolism in freshwater turtles , a highly threatened group . This research emphasises the value of integrating microbiota and metabolomic data in conservation strategies and highlights the need for further longitudinal studies to explore the dynamic host microbiota relationship in these understudied species .
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key driver of cancer progression , with therapies increasingly targeting metabolic weaknesses . Peptide YY ( PYY ) , a gastrointestinal hormone , regulates cellular activity , but its influence on mitochondrial health in lung cancer remains poorly understood . We explored how PYY1 36 , a bioactive fragment of PYY , affects mitochondrial stability in NCI H1581 lung cancer cells . Using dose response experiments , we measured oxidative stress by tracking lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) release , mitochondrial ROS levels , and oxidative DNA damage ( 8 OHdG ) . Energy production was evaluated through ATP levels , oxygen consumption rates ( OCR ) , and Complex I activity . We also analyzed mitochondrial biogenesis markers ( NRF1 , TFAM , PGC 1alpha ) and the RNA binding protein RBM43 via qPCR and immunoblotting . Dose dependent tests showed that PYY1 36 triggers mitochondrial oxidative damage , marked by higher LDH release and ROS spikes . These changes aligned with sharp drops in ATP production and disrupted respiratory function . Notably , PYY1 36 reduced mitochondrial mass and biogenesis , supported by weaker MitoTracker Red signals and lower mtDNA/nDNA ratios . Key regulators NRF1 and TFAM were strongly suppressed , pointing to widespread mitochondrial failure . Intriguingly , PYY1 36 blocked PGC 1alpha protein synthesis without altering mRNA levels , suggesting a post transcriptional control mechanism . PYY1 36 also boosted RBM43 levels . Knocking down RBM43 reversed PYY1 36 ' s effects on PGC 1alpha and mitochondrial health . Our findings reveal RBM43 as a central player in PYY1 36 induced mitochondrial dysfunction through its suppression of PGC 1alpha translation . Targeting RBM43 could unlock new strategies to tackle metabolic chaos in lung cancer .
BACKGROUND : Metabolic reprogramming plays an important role in therapeutic efficacy of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . However , the metabolic reprogramming related key genes associated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) treatment sensitivity in HCC remain further investigation . METHODS : We analyzed data from public databases , The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus , as well as metabolism related genes ( MRGs ) , to identify key genes associated with TACE treatment sensitivity . Further analysis was conducted on the relationship between key genes and immune cell infiltration , HCC related genes , regulatory network construction , nomogram construction , and drug sensitivity analysis . Finally , the expression of key genes was validated based on databases and in vitro RT qPCR . RESULTS : Four key genes ( CDC20 , LPCAT1 , PON1 , and SPP1 ) associated with TACE treatment sensitivity were identified . Increased CDC20 , LPCAT1 , and SPP1 and reduced PON1 were found in tumor tissues than normal tissues , as well as in advanced patients than early stage patients . Lower expression of CDC20 , LPCAT1 , and SPP1 , and higher expression of PON1 were detected in responsive patients than non responsive patients . Patients with high expression of CDC20 , LPCAT1 , and SPP1 , and low expression of PON1 had poor prognosis . They were also correlated with tumor immune microenvironment and sensitivity to multiple chemotherapy drugs . The expressions of key genes at the gene and protein levels were validated . CONCLUSIONS : Our study provided systematic insights into identification of biomarkers for TACE treatment sensitivity in HCC .
Heightened sympathetic reflexes ( sympathetic hyperreflexia , SH ) post high level spinal cord injury ( SCI ) detrimentally impact effector organs , resulting in peripheral immune dysfunction and cardiovascular disease , two leading causes of morbidity and mortality in SCI . We previously found that an activated neuroimmune system after SCI contributes to intraspinal plasticity in the spinal sympathetic reflex ( SSR ) circuit , underlying SH . We hypothesize that activation of NF kappaB , a key regulator of inflammation , in spinal cord below SCI contributes to driving SSR circuit plasticity , resulting in SH associated autonomic dysreflexia ( AD ) and peripheral immune dysfunction . Here , we demonstrate inhibition of central NF kappaB signaling via intrathecal delivery of dimethylamino parthenolide ( DMAPT ) significantly decreases SH post complete transection of thoracic spinal segment 3 in adult rats . This included reduced AD severity that was associated with decreased interneuron recruitment into the SSR circuit after SCI . We also observed intrathecal DMAPT treatment improved survival post SCI that corresponded with normalized numbers of splenic regulatory T cells . These findings underscore central NF kappaB signaling as a key component driving SH after SCI .
A decentralized electrochemical immunosensor was developed using a smartphone and a portable electrochemical workstation . The system employs a gold nanoflower modified screen printed carbon electrode ( AuNFs/SPCE ) for the sensitive measurement of adalimumab ( ADL ) in human serum via antigen‒antibody recognition . Scanning electron microscopy , X ray photoelectron spectroscopy , and atomic force microscopy were used to investigate the AuNFs/SPCE . Compared with the bare SPCE , the AuNFs/SPCE has a 47 fold larger specific surface area , which enhances the capture efficiency of ADL for signal amplification . Electrode modification and antigen‒antibody assembly processes are characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy . The immunosensor achieves excellent electrochemical properties by optimizing experimental conditions , which improves the signal to noise ratio and thus the analytical performance . Under the best experimental conditions , the immunosensor has a quantitative range of 05‒4 mug/mL in diluted human serum with a detection limit of 1 ng/mL , which is consistent with the effective therapeutic window of ADL in clinical settings . The prepared electrodes maintain 10 day stability , while with high reproducibility at different ADL concentrations . High recoveries in the range 08‒6% are obtained in human serum samples . Furthermore , ADL in the serum samples was measured by both ELISA and the developed sensor . Pearson and Bland‒Altman analyses revealed a consistent trend between the two methods . Therefore , this immunosensor is a promising tool for the point of care ( POC ) measurement of ADL in clinical samples , providing valuable insights for personalizing ADL dosing regimens in clinical practice .
Metastatic bladder cancer is characterized by its aggressive behavior and complex molecular mechanisms that remain largely undefined . This study explores the therapeutic potential of targeting peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha ( PGC 1alpha ) using liposomal nanoparticles to deliver PGC 1alpha siRNA to bladder cancer cells . We employed comprehensive transcriptomic , proteomic , and metabolomic analyses to investigate the impact of PGC 1alpha silencing . Our in vitro results demonstrate that targeting PGC 1alpha significantly impairs mitochondrial function and disrupts energy metabolism , affecting critical pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle , as well as altering mRNA nuclear export . In vivo experiments in animal models show that nanoparticles loaded with si PGC 1alpha effectively reduce lung metastasis , indicating a significant impact on metastatic progression . These findings highlight PGC 1alpha as a key regulator of metabolic reprogramming in metastatic bladder cancer and suggest that its inhibition could serve as a promising therapeutic strategy . By elucidating the role of PGC 1alpha in cancer metabolism , this study provides new insights into the molecular underpinnings of bladder cancer metastasis and offers potential avenues for developing targeted therapies aimed at the metabolic vulnerabilities of this malignancy .
The overexpression of key biosynthetic genes involved in triptolide production through a metabolic engineering strategy significantly enhanced triptolide accumulation in Tripterygium wilfordii hairy roots . Triptolide , the representative bioactive compound in Tripterygium wilfordii , is renowned for its potent insecticidal and pharmacological properties . In order to increase the production of triptolide , this study overexpressed several key enzyme genes related to its biosynthesis in T . wilfordii hairy roots . Specifically , the content of triptolide in hairy roots overexpressing TwTPS9 and TwTPS27 individually was found to be 60 fold and 42 fold that of the control , respectively . Co expression of both TwTPS9 and TwTPS27 resulted in significant increase in triptolide levels , reaching approximately 72 times that of the control . Furthermore , overexpressing TwGGPPS and TwDXS on the basis of the double gene overexpression led to the highest triptolide production , with a yield of 83 mg/L , increasing to 18 fold compared to the control . This study offers valuable examples into the efficient biosynthesis of triptolide and is expected to lay a foundation for future industrial scale production by mitigating its resource constraints through metabolic engineering .
This study evaluated the effectiveness of N1 methylpseudouridine modified mRNA encoding bone morphogenetic protein 2 ( BMP 2 mRNA LNP ) in promoting bone growth and improving titanium implant integration in rat femur bone defects . Sixteen Sprague Dawley rats ( 32 femurs ) were used , with titanium wires implanted in the femoral defects . The defects were divided into four groups ( n = 8 ) : 5 microg BMP 2 mRNA LNP , 15 microg BMP 2 mRNA LNP , recombinant BMP 2 ( rhBMP 2 ) , and Dulbecco ' s phosphate buffered saline ( dPBS ) . Following euthanasia at 3 and 6 weeks , Micro Computed Tomography ( micro CT ) was performed to assess bone volume , trabecular architecture , and bone to implant contact . Push out mechanical testing determined the maximal loading force for implant dislodgment , while elemental analysis using Energy Dispersive X ray Spectroscopy ( EDS ) and Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) assessed mineralization on the titanium surfaces . The 15 microg BMP 2 mRNA LNP group demonstrated significantly enhanced bone volume , trabecular thickness , and bone to implant contact compared to the control group ( p < 05 ) . Additionally , this group showed higher calcium and phosphorus content , indicating superior mineralization . Concomitantly , the mean maximal loading force ( N ) increased in the BMP 2 mRNA LNP group , though this increase was not statistically significant . These results suggest that BMP 2 mRNA LNP offers a promising approach to enhance peri implant bone formation and bone regeneration . While the 15 microg group showed slightly greater bone formation , most experimental parameters showed no significant differences compared to the 5 microg group , suggesting the lower dose may offer a more cost effective approach without compromising efficacy .
Hair lichen photoprotection involves algal and fungal strategies while hydrated , with pale lichens compensating weak fungal cortical pigments through high , rapidly induced non photochemical quenching by the photobiont . Hair lichens play vital roles in boreal forests by influencing nutrient cycles , microclimates , and providing habitats for invertebrates and forage for animals . This study examines two widespread and dominant species , Bryoria fuscescens and Alectoria sarmentosa , which possess different fungal pigments dark light absorbing melanin in Bryoria , and pale reflecting usnic acid in Alectoria . These cortical pigments affect species distribution , with Bryoria favoring sun exposed forest canopies due to its efficient light protective melanin , while Alectoria thrives in partly shaded , moist environments . By investigating sympatric populations , we explored whether non photochemical quenching ( NPQ ) compensates for Alectoria ' s less effective sun screening pigment . Our results reveal that Alectoria exhibits higher and more rapidly induced NPQ compared to Bryoria , along with faster recovery from photoinhibition . The flexibility and rapid response of Alectoria ' s NPQ help mitigate high light stress , optimizing growth in fluctuating light environments . These compensatory mechanisms suggest that , despite weaker cortical pigmentation , hydrated Alectoria can sustain photosynthesis and recover from light induced damage more efficiently . However , because NPQ does not function in the desiccated state where efficient sun screening by cortical pigments is essential Alectoria is confined to humid and sheltered forest canopies in drier macroclimates but not in rainforest climates . This study underscores the adaptive strategies of both photobionts and mycobionts in hydrated hair lichens to manage varying light conditions in boreal forests , highlighting NPQ as a compensating mechanism in lichen photoprotection . It advances our understanding by illustrating how the transition from dry to wet conditions amplifies the algal partner ' s contribution to overall photoprotection .
Muscle weakness is a risk factor for multiple diseases . However , most protocols to assess muscle weakness require clinical settings . A difficulty lifting 5 kg may be a simple measure of muscle weakness in domestic settings . However , no relevant study on assessing muscle weakness has been reported . We investigated the associations of difficulty lifting 5 kg with various musculoskeletal , cardiovascular , metabolic , and neurological diseases in geriatric adults aged 50 or above from 15 countries ( n = 51 , 536 ) over five years . The data was collected by the Survey of Health , Ageing , and Retirement in Europe ( SHARE ) conducted between 2013 and Overall , 10 , 025 ( 5% ) respondents exhibited difficulty lifting 5 kg at baseline in Over the next four years , these respondents exhibited higher risks for developing a low quality of life ( QoL ) ( 42% ) , depression ( 14% ) , low handgrip strength ( 38% ) , and osteoarthritis ( 98% ) after adjusting for age and gender . Additionally , these respondents exhibited mild to moderate risks for developing rheumatoid arthritis , heart attack , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , Alzheimer ' s disease , stroke , or hip fracture ( all p < 05 ) . After adjusting for age and country , the risks of developing various diseases were higher in men than in women . Collectively , difficulty lifting 5 kg can herald the onset of several cardiovascular , neurological , and musculoskeletal disorders along with a reduced QoL . We suggest that difficulty lifting 5 kg may be a valuable indicator of muscle weakness and poor health in domestic settings .
Schizophrenia , a pervasive mental health condition , poses a global challenge to individual well being . The intricate interplay of schizophrenia with the aging process is characterized by a shortened lifespan , underscoring the urgent need for an in depth exploration of the underlying biological mechanisms that contribute to the unique aging trajectory within this specific patient population . Currently , this crucial aspect remains largely unexplored . To bridge this knowledge gap , in the present study , serum samples from of 29 subjects with schizophrenia were analysed via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC MS ) and compared with those of 30 nonpsychiatric controls . This exploratory analysis of circulating blood serum , albeit based on a limited sample size , provides valuable insights into the significantly altered molecular pathways linked to schizophrenia and clarifies the unique aspects of aging in the context of this particular disease . The data presented in this study constitute a compilation of molecular alterations associated with schizophrenia across the human lifespan . By distinguishing between schizophrenia patients and nonpsychiatric controls , we identified a panel of 342 differentially abundant metabolites and 544 differentially expressed proteins . Our pathway enrichment analysis was focused primarily on histone acetylation , the Wnt/beta catenin signaling pathway , the dopamine receptor signaling pathway , and fatty acid beta oxidation , highlighting their pivotal roles in schizophrenia . Furthermore , we conducted a co occurrence analysis of these metabolites and proteins , aiming to elucidate their connection with accelerated aging processes . This analysis revealed the involvement of metabolic pathways crucial for lipid metabolism , such as the peroxisome and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ( PPAR ) signaling pathways , as well as neurotransmitter related metabolic pathways influencing tryptophan metabolism and the dopaminergic synapse pathway . The findings significantly increase our understanding of the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying schizophrenia and its co occurring comorbidities across the spectrum of aging , providing insights into the dynamics of the progression of this complex disorder . However , this study has certain limitations , particularly the lack of its findings and the relatively small sample size , especially in the proteomic analysis .
BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is the leading cause of mortality among maintenance hemodialysis patients , with iron metabolism disorders , particularly involving hepcidin , contributing to this heightened risk . This study aimed to evaluate whether serum hepcidin 25 levels are associated with the incidence of new CVD events in maintenance hemodialysis patients , using a novel , clinically applicable assay . METHODS : In this prospective , multicenter observational study , 567 maintenance hemodialysis patients from the INFINITY Cohort in Japan were followed for one year . Serum hepcidin 25 levels were measured using a latex turbidimetric immunoassay . The primary outcome was the incidence of new CVD events , including myocardial infarction , angina , and stroke . Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with new CVD events . RESULTS : During the one year follow up , 42 patients ( 4% ) experienced new CVD events . Patients with new CVD events had significantly lower serum hepcidin 25 levels compared to those without events ( 0 vs . 8 ng/mL , P < 05 ) . Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lower hepcidin 25 levels ( odds ratio 82 , 95% confidence interval 72 94 , P = 0036 ) , higher glycoalbumin levels , and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were independently associated with increased CVD risk . CONCLUSIONS : Lower serum hepcidin 25 levels were independently associated with an increased risk of new CVD events in maintenance hemodialysis patients . Serum hepcidin 25 may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting cardiovascular risk , and addressing iron deficiency could help mitigate this risk .
OBJECTIVES : The association between metabolically healthy abdominal obesity ( MHO ) and subclinical cardiovascular outcomes in the general pediatric population remains largely unexplored . We aimed to investigate the relationship of MHO with left ventricular geometric ( LVG ) remodeling in Chinese children . METHODS : Data were obtained from two school based cross sectional studies in China , involving 2866 children aged 6 11 years . Abdominal obesity was defined using waist to height ratio ( WHtR ) or waist circumference references . The metabolically healthy phenotype was defined by the absence of four cardiovascular risk factors : elevated blood pressure , elevated triglycerides , elevated fasting blood glucose , and decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol . LVG was categorized into four patterns ( normal geometry , concentric remodeling , eccentric hypertrophy , and concentric hypertrophy ) based on two indices including left ventricular mass index and relative wall thickness . RESULTS : Using WHtR to define abdominal obesity , 543 ( 9% ) children were classified as MHO . In the multivariable logistic regression models , compared with children with metabolically healthy normal WHtR , the adjusted odds ratios ( 95% confidence intervals ) of children with MHO were 78 ( 44 64 ) for left ventricular hypertrophy , 81 ( 33 47 ) for high relative wall thickness , 45 ( 01 08 ) for concentric remodeling , 37 ( 01 33 ) for eccentric hypertrophy , and 50 ( 77 91 ) for concentric hypertrophy . In contrast , children with metabolically unhealthy normal WHtR did not exhibit increased odds of any type of LVG remodeling . Similar results were observed when defining abdominal obesity based on waist circumference . CONCLUSIONS : MHO is associated with a higher likelihood of LVG remodeling , suggesting that this phenotype may not be benign for the heart in children . Due to its simplicity and practicality , WHtR may be a preferable tool for the rapid screening of children with abdominal obesity and associated cardiac risk .
In the past decades , the pathogenic role of hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) in the development of liver fibrosis and its complications has been deeply characterized , rendering HSCs a primary target for antifibrotic therapies . By contrast , the beneficial roles of HSCs in liver homeostasis and liver disease are only beginning to emerge , revealing critical regulatory and fibrosis independent functions in hepatic zonation , metabolism , injury , regeneration and non parenchymal cell identity . Here , we review how HSC mediators , such as R spondin 3 , hepatocyte growth factor and bone morphogenetic proteins , regulate critical and homeostatic liver functions in health and disease via cognate receptors in hepatocytes , Kupffer cells and endothelial cells . We highlight how the balance shifts from protective towards fibropathogenic HSC mediators during the progression of chronic liver disease ( CLD ) and the impact of this shifted balance on patient outcomes . Notably , the protective roles of HSCs are not accounted for in current therapeutic concepts for CLD . We discuss the concept that reverting the HSC balance from fibrogenesis towards hepatoprotection might represent a novel holistic treatment approach to inhibit fibrogenesis and restore epithelial health in CLD simultaneously .
Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates ( N BPs ) , widely used in bone disease therapy , inhibit the mevalonate pathway , which affects coenzyme Q ( CoQ ) biosynthesis and may compromise mitochondrial function , particularly in endothelial cells where oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to cardiovascular disease . This study examined the effects of chronic six day exposure of human endothelial cells to N BPs on mitochondrial bioenergetic functions , focusing on drug induced mitochondrial CoQ ( mtCoQ ) deficiency . Compared with the mitochondria of control cells , those of endothelial cells treated with 5 microM alendronate or 1 microM zoledronate presented a significant 45 50% decrease in total mtCoQ pool , loss of reduced ( mtCoQH ) antioxidant mtCoQ pool , and elevated mitochondrial antioxidant protein superoxide dismutase 2 ( SOD2 ) and uncoupling protein 2 ( UCP2 ) levels . Exposing endothelial cells to N BPs also led to an overall reduction in mitochondrial substrate oxidation , except for increased fatty acid oxidation . Additionally , the mitochondria of N BP treated endothelial cells presented decreased respiratory rates , membrane potential , and ATP synthesis efficiency , and increased HO production resulting from increased mtCoQ reduction during the oxidation of complex I ( CI ) and CII substrates . N BP induced mtCoQ deficiency also resulted in rearranged respiratory chain supercomplexes , particularly downregulation of the III + IV supercomplex , and decreased CII , CIII , and CV protein levels and activities . Despite the N BP induced decrease in a heme levels , maximal CIV activity remained unaffected in endothelial mitochondria . These findings highlight the role of N BPs in disrupting mtCoQ redox homeostasis and associated bioenergetic functions in endothelial mitochondria .
Psoriasis is a prevalent inflammatory skin disorder with immune related mechanisms that remain incompletely understood . To elucidate the immune landscape of psoriasis , we analyzed expression profiles to identify 115 psoriasis susceptibility genes ( PSGs ) and subsequently pinpointing eight immune related hub genes ( IRHGs ) . A predictive model incorporating these IRHGs demonstrated promising prognostic potential for psoriasis . Additionally , extensive intercellular communication was observed among keratinocytes , dendritic cells , monocytes , and T cells . The cellular differentiation trajectory revealed a complex interplay among various cell types and states , highlighting genes such as CXCL8 , CCL2 , STAT3 , and STAT1 emerging as closely associated with the cellular composition and functional status within the psoriatic immune microenvironment . The present study may shed light on the understanding of the immunopathological dynamics of psoriasis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies and biomarkers for this multifaceted skin disorder .
AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : Glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonists ( GLP 1 RAs ) are a cornerstone in type 2 diabetes management . In this study we evaluated heterogeneity in body weight and glycaemic responses to the initiation of liraglutide , semaglutide or dulaglutide in real world clinical practice . METHODS : Data from 4467 adults with type 2 diabetes in the Diabetes Patient Follow up ( DPV ) registry were analysed , focusing on changes in HbA ( 1c ) and body weight over 6 months following initiation of a GLP 1 RA . We categorised participants based on their response : HbA ( 1c ) reduction only , weight loss only , both or neither . This analysis was part of the IMI Stratification of Obesity Phenotypes to Optimize Future Obesity Therapy ( IMI SOPHIA ) project . RESULTS : At 6 months ' follow up the median absolute HbA ( 1c ) reduction was 3 mmol/mol ( IQR 9 , 0 ) ( 49% [27 , 09] ) and relative body weight reduction was 43% ( 26 , 0 ) . Only 14% of participants achieved meaningful reductions in both HbA ( 1c ) ( absolute reduction >/=5 mmol/mol [5%] ) and body weight ( relative reduction >/=5% ) . Men and those with a higher baseline HbA ( 1c ) were more likely to show an HbA ( 1c ) only response ( 36% of participants ; both p<001 ) , while older individuals and those with a longer diabetes duration were more likely to experience a weight only response ( 7% of participants ; both p<001 ) . Higher baseline body weight and lower eGFR ( both p<05 ) correlated with greater weight reduction , whereas lower baseline HbA ( 1c ) and longer diabetes duration were linked to smaller HbA ( 1c ) reductions ( both p<001 ) . CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION : There is significant heterogeneity in responses to GLP 1 RA therapy among individuals with type 2 diabetes in routine clinical practice . However , in our study a substantial proportion achieved a reduction in either body weight or HbA ( 1c ) . Future studies should explore why some individuals achieve either weight loss or HbA ( 1c ) reduction but not both .
AIMS/HYPOTHESIS : Insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes is associated with elevated plasma branched chain amino acid ( BCAA ) levels . Here , we examined whether the ability of insulin to clear plasma BCAAs and any influence of acute exercise or exercise training on this response are intact in obesity and type 2 diabetes . METHODS : In four case control studies of participants with type 2 diabetes matched to glucose tolerant individuals with obesity and lean individuals , who underwent hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamps , we examined the effect of insulin on plasma BCAAs ( studies I IV ) , with or without prior acute exercise ( 60 min , 70% V O2max ) ( study II ) , and before and after 10 weeks of endurance exercise training ( study III ) or 8 weeks of high intensity interval training ( study IV ) . RESULTS : Insulin sensitivity was reduced in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with individuals with obesity ( study I IV ) and lean individuals ( studies I and IV ) , and in individuals with obesity vs lean individuals ( study I ) ( all p<05 ) . Exercise training ( studies III and IV ) increased insulin sensitivity in all groups ( all p<01 ) . Plasma BCAAs were elevated in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with individuals with obesity ( studies I , III and IV ) and lean individuals ( studies I and IV ) ( all p<05 ) . The ability of insulin to reduce plasma BCAAs was significantly attenuated in participants with type 2 diabetes compared with both lean individuals ( studies I and IV ) and individuals with obesity ( studies I , II and IV ) ( all p<05 ) . Acute exercise slightly reduced plasma BCAAs in both individuals with type 2 diabetes and individuals with obesity but did not potentiate insulin ' s ability to reduce plasma BCAAs ( study II ) . Exercise training had no impact on fasting BCAAs and did not affect insulin ' s ability to reduce plasma BCAAs in any group ( studies III and IV ) or rescue the attenuated insulin suppression of plasma BCAAs in participants with type 2 diabetes . CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION : Our results demonstrate that insulin ' s ability to suppress plasma BCAAs is impaired in type 2 diabetes but is intact in individuals with obesity . Although acute exercise reduces fasting BCAA levels , neither acute exercise nor exercise training affects insulin ' s ability to suppress plasma BCAAs in glucose tolerant individuals with or without obesity or in individuals with type 2 diabetes .
Pancreatic cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide , largely due to the limitations of current clinical strategies for its treatment . As a result , identifying genetic alterations and potential therapeutic targets could offer new opportunities for improving the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer . The identification of differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) and subsequent analyses , including signaling pathway enrichment , functional classification , and protein protein interaction ( PPI ) network construction , were conducted using three public datasets : GSE32676 , GSE71989 , and GSE Kaplan Meier survival curves and receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves were employed to investigate the correlation between hub genes and clinicopathological features in pancreatic cancer patients . Genetic alterations were analyzed using the CBioPortal web tool . Cell proliferation was assessed through CCK 8 , colony formation , and EdU assays . Tumor migration , invasion , and angiogenesis were evaluated using transwell and tube formation assays , respectively . Protein and mRNA expression levels were measured via western blot analysis and qPCR assays . The subcutaneous xenografted nude mice models were generated to evaluate the potential effect of miR 485 3p/MELK cascade on tumor growth in vivo . Our analysis revealed that MELK expression is positively correlated with poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer . The overexpression or knockdown of MELK significantly influences cell proliferation , tumor metastasis , and angiogenesis across various pancreatic cancer cell lines . Furthermore , we identified that miR 485 3p regulates MELK expression by directly targeting the MELK 3 ' UTR binding site in pancreatic cancer cells , which subsequently impacts tumor progression . Additionally , our findings demonstrate that the miR 485 3p/MELK cascade is closely associated with tumor progression in pancreatic cancer cells . Mechanistically , the miR 485 3p/MELK cascade promotes the phosphorylation of Akt to regulate pancreatic cancer cell progression , metastasis , and angiogenesis . Furthermore , overexpression of miR 485 3p inhibits the tumor growth induced by MELK overexpression in subcutaneous xenograft model . MiR 485 3p/MELK cascade may serve as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer .
Angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of solid tumors . Exosomes are extracellular vesicles , which are involved in multiple stages of tumor progression . The role of macrophage derived exosomes in angiogenesis in oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) , where macrophages are crucial components of the tumor microenvironment ( TME ) , remains to be explored . The M2 macrophages and microvessels in OSCC were stained by immunohistochemistry . M2 macrophages were induced in vitro and exosomes were extracted by gradient centrifugation using ultracentrifugation . Fluorescence confocal microscopy was used to observe the uptake of M2 macrophage derived exosomes by human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . CCK 8 proliferation assay , TRANSWELL migration assay and tube formation assay were used to detect the effects of M2 macrophage derived exosomes on the proliferation , migration and tube formation of HUVECs . Immunohistochemical study showed that M2 macrophage infiltration was positively correlated with microvessel density in OSCC . We induced M2 macrophages in vitro and successfully extracted its exosomes . The cellular internalization of fluorescence labeled exosomes by HUVECs was dynamically monitored via laser scanning confocal microscopy . The M2 macrophage derived exosomes promoted the proliferation , migration , and tube forming ability of HUVECs . The results showed that M2 macrophage derived exosomes could promote the proliferation , migration and tubulation of HUVECs .
Transactive response DNA binding Protein 43 ( TDP 43 ) aggregation is a key pathological feature in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and related neurodegenerative diseases . This study investigates the inhibitory effects of Epigallocatechin 3 gallate ( EGCG ) , a polyphenol found in green tea , on TDP 43 aggregation . Using a combination of fluorescence assays , NMR spectroscopy , and computational modeling , we demonstrate that Epigallocatechin 3 gallate significantly delays the nucleation phase of TDP 43 aggregation process , thus inhibiting the formation of TDP 43 aggregates in vitro . Additionally , we proved a direct interaction of the compound with the RNA recognition motifs of TDP 43 and modeled the mechanism of interaction . Our findings reveal that EGCG stabilizes the RRM domains , counteracting aggregation by interfering with the early stages of the amyloidogenic pathway . Furthermore , EGCG ' s stability under experimental conditions was ensured using reducing agents , highlighting the importance of maintaining its reduced form for reproducible results . These insights underscore the therapeutic potential of EGCG in TDP 43 proteinopathies and provide a foundation for developing targeted treatments for ALS and related disorders .
Streptococcus pneumoniae , a Gram positive , human specific commensal infectious pathogen , poses a significant global health threat , especially in children under five , often resulting in fatalities . The intricacies of the immune response in pneumococcal meningitis ( PM ) remain elusive , necessitating a meticulous examination of immune cell subsets at the single cell resolution . In this study , we performed single cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PM patients and healthy individuals . We found significant relative changes in the compositions of immune cell subset , with significant relative increases in platelets , neutrophils , and their precursors , alongside relative decreases in natural killer ( NK ) cells , T cell subtypes , and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in PM patients . Functional enrichment analyses revealed an up regulation of neutrophils related immune genes across multiple immune cell types , including platelets , myeloid cells and B cells , suggesting excessive neutrophil activation . However , a down regulation of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation in myeloid cells and B cells in the PM group indicated a relative dampening of the adaptive immune response in the PM patients . This was further corroborated by the reduced proportions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and T cells . Furthermore , genes involved in cytotoxity were down regulated in both NK cells and T cells , alongside impaired T cell activation . Notably , distinct B cell subtypes , including unique naive B cell clusters , demonstrated differentially expressed genes associated with both innate and adaptive immune responses . In conclusion , our study provides a comprehensive single cell transcriptomic landscape of immune responses in PM . The identified cellular and molecular signatures offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention and provide a foundation for further investigation into the immunopathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis .
We aimed to explore the effectiveness of CTH as a serum inflammation biomarker for HCC . Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect serum levels of CTH , interleukin 6 ( IL 6 ) , C reactive protein ( CRP ) , and IL The Scheuer scoring system was used to assess the liver inflammation grading ( significant liver inflammation : >/= G2 grade ) . CTH levels in the HCC group were significantly elevated ( P < 0001 ) . Of 146 patients , 22% exhibited significant liver inflammation . CTH levels in patients with significant liver inflammation were significantly higher than those in patients with no or mild liver inflammation ( < G 2 ) ( p < 0001 ) . The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve for CTH in predicting significant hepatitis was 77 ( sensitivity , 2% ; specificity , 3% ) . There was a significant positive correlation ( r = 50 , p < 05 ) between serum CTH levels and histopathological parameter G . The area under the ROC curve for CTH in predicting hepatocellular carcinoma was 83 ( sensitivity , 6% ; specificity , 3% ) . CTH and AFP improved the diagnostic accuracy of HCC . CTH levels significantly decreased 6 months post operation ( p < 05 ) . The recurrence of HCC caused significant increases in CTH levels . Thus , CTH can serve as a serum inflammation marker for HCC .
On September 1 , 2019 , China implemented the " Blood Station Technical Operation Procedures ( 2019 Edition ) , " specifying Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) and Chemiluminescent Immunoassay ( CLIA ) for serological testing . However , no CLIA HIV reagent has been approved for blood donor screening in China . This study evaluates the WT CMIA reagents for HIV screening in blood stations , providing evidence for their approval as a national screening tool . A controlled trial compared WT CMIA and ELISA reagents , as well as CLIA reagents from other manufacturers , through clinical experiments and reference serum panel testing . Evaluation metrics included precision , sensitivity , specificity , detection limit , method comparison , and reference range . Clinical Experiments : Among 10 , 470 blood donor samples , WT CMIA detected 100% of confirmed HIV infected donors ( 42/42 ) , compared to 62% for ELISA ( 41/42 ) . CMIA and Wantai ELISA both had a specificity of 96% , Lizhu ELISA 98% . Kappa values between CMIA and ELISA methods were 90 and Reference Serum Testing : Both CMIA and ELISA demonstrated 100% sensitivity ( 148/148 ) . CMIA had a CV under 5% , while ELISA methods exceeded 5% . WT CMIA detected 03% of early HIV infections , compared to 07% for Roche and Abbott CLIA . Detection titers for HIV subtypes were not lower than 1 : 40 , with a detection limit of 25 IU/mL for the P24 antigen , meeting WHO standards . WT CMIA shows high consistency with ELISA and superior sensitivity for early HIV detection , meeting WHO standards for blood donor screening in China .
The emerging fungal pathogen Candida auris is notorious for environmental persistence , which is a major contributor to outbreaks in healthcare settings . Here we report that giant lipid droplets ( gLDs ) inside C . auris cells play critical roles in the ability to survive harsh environments . C . auris cells that contain gLDs exhibit an increased tolerance to environmental stresses , antifungals , and host associated antimicrobial peptides . These cells often undergo significant cell wall remodeling and sloughing of the outer layer of the cell wall . Lipidomics analysis indicates that cells with gLDs contain a significantly higher level of triacylglycerols , sterol esters , and other lipids , such as glycerolipids , sphingolipids , and sterol lipids . At the transcriptional level , a large set of differentially expressed genes was observed between C . auris cells with and without gLDs . Our study reveals that gLDs are a new strategy used by C . auris to adapt to stressful conditions and to persist in hospital environments .
The challenge of early detection and stratification in Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) is urgent due to the current emergence of mechanism based disease modifying treatments . In here , metabolomic and lipidomic parameters obtained by a standardized and targeted in vitro diagnostic research ( IVDr ) platform have a significant potential to address therapy related questions and generate improved biomarker panels . Our study aimed to use IVDr nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy to quantify metabolites and lipoproteins in PD blood serum from different cohorts to stratify metabolically driven subtypes of idiopathic and genetic PD . Serum aliquots from three neurodegeneration biobank cohorts ( 287 samples in total , including 62 PD patient samples with GBA mutation , 98/43 PD patient samples of early/late stages of disease duration , 20 PD samples from patients with mutations in recessive PD genes and some smaller subgroups of mitochondrial and double mutation cases ) were prepared and analyzed with IVDr NMR spectroscopy , covering 39 blood serum metabolites and 112 lipoprotein parameters . Uni and multivariate statistics were used to identify metabolism driven changes under consideration of typical confounders such as age , sex and disease duration and set into context with clinical biomarkers such as CSF concentrations of alpha synuclein , neurofilament light chain , and tau protein . Based on the different PD subgroups we performed a total of eight different comparisons . Highlights from these comparisons include increased citrate and dimethylglycine with a decrease of creatinine and methionine in healthy controls and early PD group compared to GBA , PD late and recessive PD . We furthermore identified decreased HDL 3 free cholesterol in genetic PD cases compared to sporadic subject samples ( sum of the PD early and PD late groups ) . Considering medication , we found that the levodopa equivalent daily dose ( LEDD ) is mostly positively correlated with tyrosine and citrate in sporadic PD compared to pyruvate and phenylalanine in genetic PD . Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alpha synuclein were negatively correlated with alanine . Further metabolites and lipoproteins with discriminatory power for double mutation PD cases involved ornithine , 2 aminobutyrate and 2 hydroxybutyrate as well as for mitochondrial phenotypes via LDL phospholipid , apolipoprotein and cholesterol subfractions . Quantitative IVDr NMR serum spectroscopy is able to stratify PD patient samples of different etiology and can contribute to a wider understanding of the underlying metabolism driven alterations e . g . in energy , amino acid , and lipoprotein metabolism . Though our overall cohort was large , major confounders such as age , sex and medication have a strong impact . That is why absolute quantification and detailed patient knowledge about metabolic confounders , is a premise for future translation of NMR serum spectroscopy to routine PD diagnostics .
The hippocampus is an archicortical structure that is highly sensitive to experience and is made up of individual subfields . These subfields , crucial for learning and memory , rapidly develop and are vulnerable to early stress , yet the mechanisms are unknown . Here , we analyse data from 520 neonates born between 23 and 42 weeks ' gestation to assess how early extrauterine exposure related stress influences subfield maturation . Subfields are segmented automatically by training a U net model on infant data using HippUnfold , a novel tool for subfield segmentation . Results indicate that subfield volumes are resilient to early stress , while myelination shows greater vulnerability and variation , which may contribute to long term outcomes . Notably , subfields are not uniformly impacted by stress , with CA1 and CA2 showing the largest effects . Developmental context , including time spent in and ex utero , primarily influences hippocampal subfield myelination .
Endophytic fungi in medicinal plants aid in producing useful therapeutic compounds and enzymes . Among the most useful enzymes are cellulases . However , cellulase enzyme production in endophytic fungi of Azadirachta indica and Aloe secundiflora has not been comprehensively explored . The objective of this study was to ; isolate and identify endophytic fungi from the leaves of young and mature plants of A . indica and A . secundiflora , determine colonization frequency of the endophytic fungi , and evaluate and optimize the cellulase production by the endophytic fungi on maize cob media . Eleven fungal endophytic isolates were obtained from the leaves of both A . secundiflora and A . indica , collected in Kitui and Kiambu Counties in total : Six from Kitui County and five from Kiambu County . Penicillium Sp . had highest colonization frequency in Kitui , while Candida sp . had highest in Kiambu . For enzyme optimization , isolates Candida boidinii , Galactomyces candidum , and Candida stellimalicola produced the highest amounts of Fpases and endoglucanases on third , sixth and ninth days . High exoglucanase producers were Colletotrichum gloeosporioides , Galactomyces candidum , and Candida stellimalicola . The endophytic communities within the leaves of A . indica and A . secundiflora are diverse . Maize cob agrowaste media can be used to cultivate the production of cellulases successfully in fungal endophytic isolates of A . indica and A . secundiflora . The study concluded that the endophytes of A . indica and A . secundiflora can be harnessed and optimized to secrete cellulase enzymes for commercial use , and especially isolates G . candidum and C . stellimalicola which yield significantly high amounts of total cellulases , endoglucanases and exoglucanases .
Endoparasitic wasps produce several factors , such as polydnavirus , venom and a specialized group of wasp embryonic cells named teratocytes , to condition their hosts and support the development of parasitoid offspring . However , the role of the developing parasitoid larvae in host adaption and regulation remains largely unknown . By analyzing RNA seq data of Cotesia vestalis , an endolarval parasitoid of the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella , we discovered that most of the larval stage highly expressed genes are associated with nutrient metabolism , including carbohydrate , protein , and lipid metabolism . We also identified hundreds of C . vestalis larvae secreted proteins . A large proportion of the secreted proteins ( 126/404 ) are encoded by larval highly expressed genes . Besides several immune related proteins , most of the secreted proteins are closely related to carbohydrate , protein , and amino acid metabolism . We further demonstrated that eleven genes linked to amino acid metabolism that encode secretory proteins were upregulated in 2nd instar larvae . These results suggest a relatively positive correlation between gene expression and secreted proteins . In summary , our study presents the secretory proteome of an endolarval parasitoid , highlighting its potential function in nutritional and immune regulation within the host , which would benefit the growth and development of parasitoid progeny .
This study sought to investigate the anticancer efficacy of limocitrin on two distinct human oral cancer cell lines . At first , we evaluated the effect of limocitrin on the proliferation of OSCC cells ( SCC 9 and SCC 47 ) using MTT and colony formation assays . Limocitrin treatment increased cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase , induced caspase related apoptosis ( cleaved caspase 3 , caspase 8 , caspase 9 and PARP expression ) in OSCC cells . Limocitrin treatment inhibited Bcl 2 and Bcl XL and induced Bax , Bak expression in both SCC 9 and SCC 47 cell lines . Limocitrin treatment inhibited cyclin E1 , E2 , CDK2 , CDK4 , and CDK6 and increased p21 expression . Limocitrin also exhibited an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of AKT , ERK1/2 and JNK in a dose dependent manner . Additionally , pretreatment of oral cancer cells with U0126 resulted in increased cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 8 and PARP expression . Furthermore , limocitrin treatment decreased XIAP , cIAP1 , HSP27 protein expression than control group . Combined treatment with limocitrin and si XIAP significantly increased cleaved PARP , caspase 3 and 8 expressions in SCC 9 cells . Overall , this evidence indicates that limocitrin may serve as an effective anticancer agent for the treatment of oral cancer .
alpha Glucosidase is a key enzyme responsible for controlling the blood glucose , making a pivotal target in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus . Present work introduces ( 1 , 2 , 4 ) triazolo[1 , 5 a]pyridine as a novel , potent scaffold for alpha glucosidase inhibition . A diverse scope of targeted compounds was prepared through an efficient , straightforward synthetic protocol . A series of compounds ( 15a 15v ) were synthesized using a simple and efficient protocol , all showing notable inhibitory activity . Among them , compound 15j exhibited the best inhibition potency ( IC = 60 +/ 09 microM ) , acting as a competitive and selective alpha glucosidase inhibitor with no effect on alpha amylase . Moreover , comprehensive computational studies were performed to validate the in vitro results and provide insight into compounds ' binding interactions within the alpha glucosidase ' s active site . The machine learning model , trained with the Estate fingerprint , achieved an AUC score of 65 , demonstrating its utility in predicting alpha glucosidase inhibition . Random Forest was identified as the most suitable model , and the dataset with the highest R value was selected for further feature selection and model improvement . Molecular docking studies demonstrated that compound 15j had a strong binding affinity toward alpha glucosidase , with a docking score of 04 kcal/mol , and formed several remarkable interactions , particularly three key hydrogen bonds with TYR158 , GLN353 , and GLU411 , contributing to its high inhibitory efficacy . The results of the molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that the 15j alpha glucosidase complex exhibits high stability and effectively maintains its binding without causing significant structural changes in the enzyme , confirming the stable interaction and selective inhibition of this compound at the enzyme ' s active site .
Currently , research has found a close correlation between childhood obesity ( CO ) and elevated levels of polyamines in the bloodstream . Thus , the identification of key genes associated with polyamines metabolism in CO could offer fresh insights for clinical management of CO . This study utilized two datasets from public databases ( GSE205668 and GSE104815 ) and 59 polyamines metabolism related genes ( PMRGs ) to screen for candidate genes . Subsequently , candidate key genes were selected using Mendelian randomization ( MR ) analysis , and machine learning algorithms were employed to obtain intersecting feature genes based on the MR results . Then key genes were identified through expression validation . Finally , we conducted research on the key genes including gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) , immune infiltration , and transcription factor ( TF ) mRNA network . Differential analysis identified 432 candidate genes linked to childhood obesity and polyamine metabolism , with 4 key genes showing causal relationships . Specifically , WWC1 , NPL , and LAPTM5 as risk factors [odd ratio ( OR ) > 1] , while GPAT3 ( OR < 1 ) was identified as a protective factor for CO . Machine learning algorithms pinpointed 3 feature genes ( WWC1 , NPL , and GPAT3 ) with significant differential expression and consistent trends . GSEA revealed ribosome and lysosome pathways linked to key genes . MITF regulated these genes in the TF mRNA network . Twelve immune cell types , mostly correlating with key genes , were identified . We identified 3 key genes ( WWC1 , NPL , and GPAT3 ) related to polyamine metabolism in CO . Additionally , we investigated their potential biological functions and regulatory mechanisms , aiming to provide new theoretical basis for the treatment and diagnosis of CO .
Uveitis is a leading cause of blindness in the world and autoimmune uveitis is an ocular tissue specific autoimmune disease . Utilizing experimental autoimmune uveitis ( EAU ) , we can interrogate different immune responses in the mouse that are relevant to the human disease . cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 ( CTLA 4 ) is an immune checkpoint molecule that has different roles depending on the target tissue . In this work we investigate the role of CTLA 4 on CD4 T cells in ocular tissue during EAU . We find that CTLA 4 is needed for both the severity of disease but also timely resolution of disease . Regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) that emerge in the spleen during resolution of EAU require CTLA 4 to suppress disease , but ocular Tregs that emerge in the eye do not require CTLA 4 to suppress disease . This report provides an additional understanding of CTLA 4 on Tregs that is specific for ocular tissue . The implications of this work are that circulating Tregs in uveitis patients may require CTLA 4 to suppress ocular inflammation but once in the eye the function of CTLA 4 is dispensable .
Aging results in a progressive decline in physiological function due to the deterioration of essential biological processes . While proteomics offers insights into aging mechanisms , prior studies are limited in proteome coverage and lifespan range . To address this , we integrate the Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer with the multiplex tandem mass tag ( TMT ) technology to profile the proteomes of cortex , hippocampus , striatum and kidney in the C57BL/6JN mice , quantifying 8 , 954 to 9 , 376 proteins per tissue ( 12 , 749 total ) . Samples spanned both sexes and three age groups ( 3 , 12 , and 20 months ) , representing early to late adulthood . To improve TMT quantitation accuracy , we develop a peptide spectrum match based filtering strategy that leverages resolution and signal to noise thresholds . Our analysis uncovers distinct tissue specific patterns of protein abundance , with age and sex differences in the kidney and primarily age related changes in brain tissues . We also identify both linear and non linear proteomic trajectories with age , revealing complex protein dynamics over the adult lifespan . Integrating our findings with early developmental proteomic data from brain tissues highlights further divergent age related trajectories , particularly in synaptic proteins . This study provides a robust data analysis workflow for Orbitrap Astral based TMT analysis and expands the proteomic understanding of aging across tissues , ages , and sexes .
Insecticides are toxic substances used to control a wide variety of agricultural insect pests . Most of these are chemicals in nature , and their increasing residues in soil , water , and fruits contribute to environmental pollution , chronic human illnesses , and the emergence of insecticide resistance phenomenon . In the context of a green environment , bioinsecticide metabolites , including proteins , are a safe alternative that mostly has selective toxicity to insects . Thus , this study aimed to predict and identify new toxin like families through uncharacterized secreted proteins from one of the most potent entomopathogenic fungi , Beauveria bassiana ARSEF 2860 , which was selected as a model . In this work , a total of 2483 amino acid sequences of uncharacterized proteins ( Ups ) were retrieved from the RefSeq database . Among these , 365 UPs were identified as secreted proteins using the SignalP web server . We implemented the integration of well designed bioinformatic tools to characterize and anticipate their homologous similarities at the sequence ( InterPro ) and structural ( AlphaFold2 ) levels . The structural function annotation of these proteins was predicted using DeepFRI . With 269 successfully predicted folds , we identified new putative families with pathogenesis functions related to toxins like Janus faced atracotoxins ( insecticidal spider toxin ) , Cry toxins ( commercial insecticide from Bacillus thuringiensis ) , ARTs like toxins , and other insecticidal toxins . Furthermore , some proteins that are not homologous to any known experimental data were functionally predicted as cation metal ion binding ( Zn , Na , and Co ) with potential toxicity . Collectively , computational structural genomics can be used to study host pathogen interactions and predict novel families .
This study employed a trans ethnic two sample Mendelian randomization ( MR ) analysis to investigate the causal relationship between membranous nephropathy ( MN ) and peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) . In European populations , MN exhibited a significant positive causal effect on PAD ( discovery : OR = 040 , P = 028 ; validation : OR = 028 , P = 031 ) , whereas no such association was observed in East Asians ( P > 05 ) . A two step mediation analysis identified several proteins influenced by MN , including thrombomodulin ( TM ) ( beta = 031 , P = 001 ) , macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 ( MCSF1 ) ( beta = 239 , P = 015 ) , stem cell factor ( SCF ) ( beta = 028 , P = 002 ) , and tissue factor ( TF ) ( beta = 031 , P = 001 ) , while MN negatively affected interleukin 1beta ( IL 1beta ) ( beta= 049 , P = 015 ) and hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) ( beta= 027 , P = 005 ) . Multivariable MR analysis confirmed that only TM had an independent positive causal effect on PAD ( beta = 225 , P < 001 ) , and mediation analysis further validated TM as a significant mediator in the MN to PAD pathway ( Z = 823 , P = 048 ) . Sensitivity analyses detected no significant pleiotropy or heterogeneity , supporting the robustness of our findings . This study highlights crucial ethnic differences in MN associated PAD risk and underscores the importance of population specific research . TM may serve as a potential therapeutic target for PAD prevention in MN patients , particularly those of European ancestry , providing novel insights into kidney vascular disease mechanisms .
Neuroblastoma ( NB ) is the most common type of pediatric extra cranial tumor that arises in the sympathetic nervous system . The heterogeneity of T cell exhaustion ( TEX ) has been linked to the determination of distinct clinical outcomes and the effectiveness of immunotherapy in numerous adult malignancies . Therefore , studying the heterogeneous TEX landscape in NB as well as its impact on clinical outcomes is meaningful . The gene expression and clinical datasets of the Sequencing Quality Control ( SEQC ) , E MTAB 8248 , and Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments ( TARGET ) cohorts were downloaded from publicly available databases . Two TEX related clusters for neuroblastoma were identified in the SEQC cohort . Patients in TEX C1 exhibited superior overall survival ( OS ) and event free survival ( EFS ) rates compared with those in TEX C And TEX C1 had more immune cells infiltrating , as well as higher expression of immune checkpoint genes . A total of 1984 genes were differentially expressed between these two clusters , of which 1712 were associated with OS . A gene signature consisting of ten TEX related genes was developed , and a risk score was computed for each patient . Based on the risk score , SEQC patients were split into high and low risk groups with significantly different survival rates . The risk score was an independent risk factor predicting survival and showed superior prediction power for 3 , 5 , and 10 year survival compared to individual clinical parameters . The signature was further confirmed in the TARGET and E MTAB 8248 cohorts . This study has successfully constructed a risk score model for NB prognosis , utilizing TEX as its foundation . The model provides risk classification and survival evaluation , which can further guide treatment .
A significant factor in relapse and dismal prognosis of glioblastoma is the migrating glioblastoma cells , which diffuse away from the tumor mass into the brain parenchyma . Post resection application of biomaterials to deliver cytotoxic agents against the invading glioblastoma cells has recently gained attention . The aim of this study was to develop a non swelling , non inflammatory biomimetic hydrogel with sustained release of a chemoattractant for glioblastoma cells and perform in vivo proof of concept studies to show chemoattraction of invading glioblastoma cells in orthotopic models of human glioblastoma . We used hyaluronic/collagen II based ( HA/Col ) hydrogel that incorporates liposomes loaded with CXCL12 to develop GliaTrap . Sustained release of CXCL12 was measured with an ELISA assay . The non inflammatory properties of GliaTrap were assessed in vivo after stereotactic implantation in the mouse brain using a cytokine array and immunohistochemistry . The efficacy of GliaTrap on attracting GSCs was determined in vivo employing 3D light sheet microscopy on orthotopic human glioblastoma xenografts . We show that GliaTrap is an injectable , non swelling biomimetic hydrogel that attains sustained release of CXCL12 and does not induce inflammation in the mouse brain . GliaTrap significantly attracts invading glioblastoma cells in orthotopic xenograft models of human glioblastoma as shown with 3D light sheet microscopy . Our findings indicate that GliaTrap can be safely used to attract invading glioblastoma cells by sustained release of a chemoattractant without inducing inflammatory conditions in the brain or local swelling .
This study aimed to identify the key cell types and their interactions in gynecological oncology of breast cancer , cervical cancer , and ovarian cancer . Single cell RNA sequencing was performed on tumor samples of gynecological oncology from the GEO database . Cell types were identified using SingleR and cell composition was analyzed to understand the tumor microenvironment ( TME ) . CellChat was used to analyze cell interactions , and pseudotemporal analysis was conducted on cancer associated fibroblasts ( CAFs ) and tumor associated macrophages ( TAMs ) to understand their differentiation status . Four CAF subtypes were identified : iCAF , myCAF , proCAF , and matCAF . The iCAF subpopulation secreted COL1A1 and promoted tumor cell migration , while myCAF was involved in angiogenesis . The matCAF subpopulation was present throughout tumor development . TAMs were found to promote angiogenesis through the VEGFA_VEGFR2 signaling pathway . CAFs and TAMs play pivotal roles in tumor progression through their interactions and signaling pathways .
A recent parallel opposed 3D conformal radiotherapy ( 3D CRT ) study in mice compared dose escalation ( boost ) in hypoxic ( pO2 </= 10 torr ) and non hypoxic tumor subvolumes . They found a hypoxic boost led to significantly greater ( p < 1e 4 ) tumor control probability than an equivalent non hypoxic boost . We imported imaging and treatment data from this study for 31 SCC7 squamous carcinoma murine leg tumor cases 16 hypoxic boost and 15 non hypoxic boost plans into a commercial treatment planning system for preclinical radiotherapy . Treatments were retrospectively recalculated with a fast Monte Carlo dose engine . We replanned cases with 3 field IMRT using an analogous uncertainty budget as 3D CRT . Comparing both treatment groups , the hypoxic boost treatments had a significantly higher hypoxic fraction receive the boost prescription as planned in 3D CRT ( p < 1e 4 ) and IMRT ( p < 1e 4 ) . Surprisingly , retrospective 3D CRT non hypoxic boost treatments had a significantly lower non hypoxic fraction receive the boost prescription ( p < 1e 4 ) . 3D CRT non hypoxic boost also substantially underdosed the entire tumor between 48 68 Gy compared to the " equivalent " hypoxic boost . In IMRT , the non hypoxic volume receiving boost prescription was significantly higher in the non hypoxic boost ( p = 0215 ) and dosing in the entire tumor was identical between boost groups . This study displays IMRT ' s potential to advance the quality of preclinical dose painting studies .
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) and trastuzumab deruxtecan ( T DXd ) have shown efficacy in HER2 positive patients with brain metastases ( BMs ) . This paper analyzed the efficacy and safety of T DXd in HER2 positive breast cancer patients with BMs who progressed after pyrotinib treatment . We conducted a single center , retrospective cohort study . HER2 positive patients with BMs who received T DXd treatment after disease progression following pyrotinib therapy were identified from electronic medical records . The primary endpoint of this study was central nervous system progression free survival ( CNS PFS ) . From April 2021 to July 2023 , 15 patients were included in the study . The median CNS PFS was 4 months [95% confidence interval ( CI ) 1 8 months] , the median PFS for patients with extracranial/total lesions was 4 months ( 95% CI 4 3 months ) , and the median OS was 8 months ( 95% CI 9 8 months ) . The ORRs for intracranial , extracranial , and overall lesions were 3% , 4% , and 3% , respectively . Adverse events of grade 3 or higher with an incidence rate >/= 5% included leukopenia ( 0% ) , neutropenia ( 3% ) , thrombocytopenia ( 7% ) , and nausea ( 7% ) . Adverse events of specific interest , interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis , occurred in 2 patents ( 3% ) , and both were grade The preliminary data in this study suggest that in clinical practice in China , T DXd is an optional treatment for patients with active/stable BMs who have progressed on pyrotinib . However , further studies are needed to determine its efficacy and the best treatment sequence for these patients .
Metabolomics is the measurement of metabolites in biological samples to reveal information on metabolic pathways and phenotypes . Cluster analysis is a popular multivariate technique employed in metabolomics to characterise observations with similar features . Previous work in the field has applied hard clustering approaches to group observations into distinct clusters . This approach can be overly restrictive in some practical applications . Therefore , there is a growing need for soft clustering methods that allow for the clustering of observations into more than one cluster . Simplex structured matrix factorisation ( SSMF ) is proposed and applied in a simulation study and to a metabolomic dataset to demonstrate its utility for soft clustering . In the simulation study , the cluster prototypes and cluster memberships were well estimated . In the real data application to metabolomic data , the presence of four soft clusters was suggested by the gap statistic . Furthermore , the Shannon diversity index indicated that several observations have memberships in three clusters . Additionally , the introduction of the covariates sex , age and BMI revealed that sex and age mainly associated with the cluster memberships . The results indicate that a majority of men and young people were in the cluster predominantly characterised by high levels of amino acids and low levels of phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins . However , a high proportion of older people were characterised by low levels of amino acids , biogenic amines , acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines . The SSMF presented successfully estimates a soft clustering of the metabolomic data . It provides an interpretable representation of the data structure using the cluster prototypes combined with cluster memberships . A software package called MetabolSSMF has been developed , which is freely available as an R package , to facilitate the implementation of soft clustering in the field of metabolomics .
m6A modifications are involved in regulating microRNA ( miRNA ) processing and maturation , and are associated with tumor development . Therefore , this study was aimed to explore the mechanism of miR 122 5p in regulating hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) progression . mRNA expression and transfection efficiency were detected by RT qPCR . Western blot was employed to measure protein level . Cell functions were evaluated through CCK 8 and transwell , respectively . Intracellular m6A levels were analyzed by MeRIP . Dual luciferase reporter gene , RIP and co IP were applied to verify the binding relationship . Xenograft tumor model was carried out for in vivo validation of miR 122 5p function . We reported that miR 122 5p was clearly lessened in HCC . Functionally , miR 122 5p introduction inhibited the malignant progression of HCC . Mechanistically , METTL14 insertion promoted miR 122 5p maturation by labeling pri miR 122 with m6A . In addition , miR 122 5p exerted suppressor effects by targeting Lysine acetyltransferase 2 A ( KAT2A ) . Moreover , we also found that KAT2A overexpression limited beta catenin expression through succinylation modification . Finally , animal data also illustrated that miR 122 5p introduction could hinder the growth of HCC tumors in vivo . We revealed the existence of a METTL14/miR 122 5p/KAT2A/beta catenin mechanistic axis in HCC , which has not been reported in the literature . This newly discovered mechanistic axis may provide new ideas for HCC therapy .
Focused ultrasound ( FUS ) with magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) guidance ( MRgFUS ) has emerged as a promising technique for enhancing drug delivery to the brain . Through the controlled oscillation of gas encased microbubbles , FUS temporarily modulates the integrity of tight junctions , inducing localized blood brain barrier disruption ( BBBD ) and allowing targeted drug passage . Aducanumab ( ADU ) has demonstrated efficacy in reducing amyloid pathology , yet its clinical application remains limited by the restrictive nature of the blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . This in vivo study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of ADU delivery facilitated by FUS induced BBBD in the normal Institute of Cancer Research ( ICR ) mouse brain under two pressure conditions : 25 and 42 MPa . Following FUS sonication with MRI guidance , ADU concentrations in brain tissues and serum were measured via enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) at multiple time points . Histological analysis at 24 h post FUS BBBD was performed to assess ADU distribution , and tissue integrity was evaluated through hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) and Nissl staining to detect potential damage in the target regions . The results demonstrated that MRgFUS significantly increased ADU concentrations within the target areas without inducing substantial tissue damage . ADU delivery efficiency was directly correlated with the degree of BBBD , exhibiting a 7 fold increase at 25 MPa and a 60 fold increase at 42 MPa compared to sham controls , with distinct kinetic profiles observed for each condition . These findings highlight the potential of FUS BBBD as a therapeutic strategy to enhance ADU delivery to the brain , reduce required infusion doses , and mitigate side effects associated with high dose administration .
The aim of the current study was to explore the association between urinary glycosaminoglycans and the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) in sepsis patients . We conducted a prospective cohort study of 49 sepsis patients and collected clinical characteristics , urine , and blood samples within 24 h of admission to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit ( SICU ) of Peking University Third Hospital . Samples from patients who did not develop ARDS were collected from day 1 to day 7 after SICU admission , while samples from patients who developed ARDS were collected from day 1 to the day of onset , forming time series data . A liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC MS ) system was used to determine urinary dermatan sulfate ( DS ) , chondroitin sulfate ( CS ) , and heparan sulfate ( HS ) concentrations ; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) and cytometric bead array ( CBA ) were used to measure plasma inflammatory factors . The endpoint was the onset of ARDS . We used generalized estimating equations to identify associations between urinary glycosaminoglycans and ARDS onset in sepsis patients . Twenty two of the 49 sepsis patients developed ARDS , and 132 plasma samples and 132 urine samples were obtained . Between the ARDS and non ARDS groups , sex , pneumonia , Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II ( APACHE II ) , Lung Injury Prediction Score ( LIPS ) , and PaO/FiO showed statistically significant differences . Generalized estimating equations showed that DS and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) were independently associated with ARDS onset in sepsis patients , but their generalizability across ARDS subtypes warrants further validation .
The rising mortality rate from cancer , driven by the absence of reliable biomarkers , highlights the pressing need for advanced diagnostic and prognostic strategies . This study investigates LZTS2 ' s role as a pan cancer biomarker , emphasizing its predictive value for immunotherapy and therapeutic targeting . Unlike existing biomarkers such as AFP in hepatocellular carcinoma or HER2 in gastric cancer , which exhibit tissue specific utility , LZTS2 demonstrates unique cross cancer applicability , as evidenced by its consistent dysregulation in both liver hepatocellular carcinoma ( LIHC ) and stomach adenocarcinoma ( STAD ) alongside emerging associations with other malignancies . Leveraging advanced bioinformatics tools and databases including UALCAN , KM plotter , and The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) , alongside experimental validation in LIHC and STAD cell lines , we analyze LZTS2 expression patterns and their clinical relevance . Notably , LZTS2 ' s dual role acting as a tumor suppressor in some cancers while promoting oncogenesis in others distinguishes it from conventional single function markers , offering novel insights into its regulatory versatility . Our findings reveal that LZTS2 mutations and expression levels are closely associated with cancer progression and patient survival , solidifying its potential as a prognostic biomarker . Notably , LZTS2 expression correlates with various clinicopathological parameters , underscoring its significance in cancer biology . Pathway analysis highlights LZTS2 ' s involvement in critical biological processes , providing actionable insights for therapeutic interventions . Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT PCR ) and quantitative methylation specific PCR ( qMSP ) experimental validations confirm these results , further establishing LZTS2 ' s utility as a multi dimensional biomarker that integrates genetic , epigenetic , and immunological features a capability rarely observed in existing markers . This comprehensive analysis positions LZTS2 as a pivotal player in cancer progression , opening promising avenues for enhanced clinical management .
The decline in neutralizing antibody ( nAb ) titers and vaccine efficacy /effectiveness ( VE ) for SARS CoV 2 vaccines has been observed over time and when confronted with emerging variants , two factors that are hard to distinguish . Despite substantial drop in nAb titers against Omicron , VE remains high for severe cases and fatalities , raising questions about the utility of detected nAbs as a correlate of protection for COVID 19 vaccines for varying disease severity . Here , we conducted a systematic comparison of waning dynamics of nAb and VE over time and against variants with varying levels of disease severity . Using Bayesian linear regression models , we found that antigenically shifted variants , like Omicron , could potentially lead to greater reductions in nAb titers and primary VE against mild infections than associated immunity waning observed over a 180 day period . By comparing model predicted nAb titers and VE on the same time scales , we found that VE against severe and fatal outcomes remained above 75% even when nAb titers reached the detectable limit of assays , despite strong correlations with nAb titers ( spearman correlations >/=7 ) across variants over time . This finding suggested detectable nAb titers are not always sensitive enough to fully predict protection against severe disease and death from SARS CoV
Myocardial infarction ( MI ) , commonly referred to as a heart attack , ranks among the foremost causes of death worldwide . The contribution of exposure to volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) to MI is still not well established . This study aims to examine how urinary metabolites of 19 volatile organic compounds ( mVOCs ) correlate with MI risk in the ordinary population . The data were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey spanning from 2011 to 2018 , a nationally representative program conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) to collect and assess the health and nutritional status of the non institutionalized U . S . population through interviews and physical examinations . The relationship between a single mVOC and MI was analyzed by applying a logistic regression model . The nonlinear relationship between a single mVOC and MI was investigated with the help of a restricted cubic spline regression model . The overall association between mVOCs and MI was examined using a weighted quantile sum ( WQS ) regression model . The analysis included 5 , 211 participants , among whom 209 experienced MI , with mVOC levels assessed . A positive association between N acetyl S ( 3 hydroxypropyl ) L cysteine ( 3HPMA ) [OR , 95 ; 95% CI , ( 06 , 58 ) ] and MI incidence was observed after adjustment for potential confounders . Similarly , N acetyl S ( 2 cyanoethyl ) L cysteine ( CYMA ) was also significantly associated with MI incidence [OR , 8 ; 95% CI , ( 14 , 83 ) ] . Each incremental unit increase in WQS was linked to a 4% rise in MI risk ( 95% CI , 05 , 38 ) . Among them , N acetyl S ( 3 , 4 dihydroxybutyl ) L cysteine ( DHBMA ) , N acetyl S ( 2 carboxyethyl ) L cysteine ( CEMA ) , CYMA , N acetyl S ( phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl ) L cysteine ( PHEMA ) , 3HPMA , and 3 and 4 methylhippuric acid ( 3 , 4MHA ) were identified as key contributors , with DHBMA showing the highest weight ( 27 ) . mVOCs are metabolic derivatives of VOC exposure , with common sources including industrial emissions , environmental pollution , and tobacco combustion . The findings revealed a significant association between urinary mVOCs and MI , implying exposure to these compounds may be linked to an increased MI risk .
Adiposity is a major risk factor for the development of cancers , such as breast cancer ( BC ) in adults . However , the role of central adiposity or general obesity as primary predictors of BC occurrence and progression is not well established . Therefore , the current study aimed to assess the association between various adiposity indices , including a body shape index ( ABSI ) , abdominal volume index ( AVI ) , body roundness index ( BRI ) , conicity index ( CI ) , body adiposity index ( BAI ) , reciprocal ponderal index ( RPI ) , and waist to height ( 5 ) ratio ( WHt ( 5 ) R ) as surrogates for predicting the odds of BC in adult women . This case control study was conducted at Shohada and Imam Hossain hospitals in Tehran and included 134 newly diagnosed BC cases and 267 controls . Anthropometric variables , including weight , height , and waist circumference were measured using standard methods , and various adiposity indices were calculated accordingly . The odds ratios ( ORs ) with 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) for BC were reported across tertiles of adiposity indices using multivariable logistic regression . Participants in the highest tertile of BRI ( OR : 07 ; 95% CI : 04 12 ) , BAI ( OR : 06 ; 95% CI : 05 03 ) , and WHt ( 5 ) R ( OR : 81 ; 95% CI : 01 55 ) had significantly higher odds of BC compared to those in the lowest tertile ( P < 05 ) . Additionally , each SD increase in RPI was associated with lower odds of BC ( OR : 77 ; 95% CI : 61 98 , P = 034 ) . However , no significant associations were observed for CI , AVI , and ABSI with the odds of BC . Our results suggest that WHtR , BRI , BAI , and WHt ( 5 ) R may be more effective predictors of BC odds among the evaluated adiposity indices .
The Arabidopsis seor1ko line , which expresses the protein AtSEOR2 free of its bond with AtSEOR1 , exhibits a lower phytoplasma titre as compared to wild type plants . In search for mechanism ( s ) underlying potential SEOR2 mediated defense responses the transcriptome of healthy wild type and Atseor1ko plants was disclosed by RNA sequencing . Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed 1036 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs , 893 up and 143 down regulated ) between the Atseor1ko line and the wild type . Sequence annotation and classification of the up regulated genes identified " plant pathogen interaction " among the most enriched clusters . The " plant pathogen interaction " cluster included genes encoding members of the protein kinase superfamily , actors in calcium/calmodulin signaling transduction and WRKY transcription factors . An interaction network analysis and a host phytoplasma interaction map demonstrated that AtSEOR2 protein could interact with the calcium binding proteins CAM2 and TCH The latter one also turned out to be an indirect target of the SAP54 ( CY ) phytoplasma effector , which suggests a SEOR2 mediated role of TCH3 in balancing nutrient investments in plant defense and plant growth .
The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemia reperfusion ( I/R ) injury are highly complex . Previous studies have indicated phenotypic changes in various cell types following stroke but have failed to identify the key regulatory genes and cell subtypes associated with the disease . The study utilized five datasets : GSE227651 , GSE104036 , GSE116878 , GSE249957 , and GSE The Seurat pipeline was employed for standard quality control and single cell data analysis . Monocle2 and CytoTRACE were used for trajectory analysis , while Mfuzz was applied to identify time series gene expression patterns . Middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) mice served as the animal model for cerebral I/R injury , and oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation ( OGD/R ) treated BV2 cells were used to simulate microglial phenotypic changes following ischemia reperfusion . qPCR , Western blotting , and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect key gene and protein alterations . P65 was identified as a key transcription factor driving inflammatory responses and transcriptional changes following ischemic stroke . Two microglial subtypes , Cx3cr1 + and Cdk1+ , were identified , with their proportions significantly increasing on days 1 and 3 after MCAO . Increased levels of inflammation , neuronal apoptosis , and P65 phosphorylation in microglia were observed in both the MCAO animal model and OGD/R cell model . Notably , inhibition of P65 phosphorylation effectively suppressed the progression of inflammation during cerebral I/R injury . We identified microglial subtypes associated with inflammatory responses following cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury , with their proportions increasing post injury . P65 was confirmed as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response , contributing to neuronal protection and the restoration of neurological function .
Bone defects are common orthopedic conditions , and due to the limited regenerative capacity of bone tissue , their repair remains a challenge in orthopedic surgery . Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) have demonstrated strong potential for osteogenic differentiation ; however , their efficiency in vivo remains restricted , particularly in terms of differentiation and migration . Photobiomodulation ( PBM ) , a non invasive therapeutic technique , has shown great promise in promoting stem cell differentiation . In this study , we cultured human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells ( hUCMSCs ) in vitro and treated them with 635/808 nm laser light . We measured alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity , mineralized nodule formation , and the expression of osteogenesis related genes and factors after 7 , 14 , and 21 days . The results showed that PBM treatment significantly enhanced hUCMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation . The mechanism behind this effect involves PBM activating the upstream Akt signaling pathway , increasing P Akt expression , and elevating reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) levels to induce mild oxidative stress . This process enhances ALP activity , mineralized nodule formation , and the expression of osteogenesis related genes and factors , thus promoting the osteogenic differentiation of hUCMSCs .
Melanoma remains one of the leading causes of cancer related mortality worldwide , necessitating advanced imaging techniques for early and accurate detection . This study assesses the dosimetry , safety , and imaging performance of a novel Ga labeled alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone ( [Ga]Ga alphaMSH ) derivative for targeting melanocortin 1 receptors ( MC1Rs ) in metastatic melanoma . In this first in human , prospective , open label clinical trial , 11 patients with histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma underwent whole body PET/CT imaging following intravenous administration of the radiolabeled compound ( 150 +/ 10 MBq ) . Tumor uptake , biodistribution , pharmacokinetics , and radiation dosimetry were evaluated at 60 and 120 min post injection . Organ and tumor uptake values were measured as standardized uptake values . Radiation dose estimates were calculated using the MIRD methodology and S values obtained from OLINDA/EXM software . Safety evaluations included monitoring adverse events , biochemical parameters , and vital signs . The radiopharmaceutical demonstrated rapid and selective uptake in metastatic melanoma lesions , achieving high tumor to background contrast within 60 min . Quantitative analysis showed substantial tumor uptake , with sustained activity at 120 min . High tumor to blood and tumor to muscle ratios ensured excellent lesion detectability . The kidneys exhibited the highest absorbed dose ( 0948 +/ 0425 mSv/MBq ) , attributed to renal excretion , whereas the brain received the lowest dose ( 0012 +/ 0007 mSv/MBq ) . Comparisons with [F]FDG and other tracers demonstrated superior dosimetry profiles , minimizing radiation exposure and enabling repeat imaging . Also , safety monitoring revealed no serious adverse events . [Ga]Ga alphaMSH analogue exhibits excellent imaging properties , favorable pharmacokinetics , and a strong safety profile , supporting its clinical utility for PET imaging of metastatic melanoma . Its high tumor specificity and minimal off target accumulation address limitations associated with [F]FDG .
Cell migration , which is often impaired under high glucose ( HG ) conditions , plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various diabetic complications . This study investigates the role of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase ( ALDH2 ) in the HG induced migratory inhibition . Using fibroblasts sub cultured in HG medium as a cell model of chronic hyperglycemia , we found that prolonged exposure to HG stress inhibited cell migration via a novel mechanism independent of oxidative stress or cell death . By increasing osmolality , HG induced perinuclear clustering of mitochondria , enhanced focal adhesion maturation , and caused the cells to be less responsive to migratory cues . The pharmacological inhibition of ALDH2 exaggerated this phenomenon , while ALDH2 overexpression protected cells from the migratory impairment caused by HG induced hyperosmolality . Cells with ALDH2 overexpression exhibited less mature focal adhesions and longer mitochondrial network , suggesting that ALDH2 might preserve mitochondrial integrity to facilitate the focal adhesion turnover during cell migration .
Abdominal aortic calcification ( AAC ) and atherosclerosis are prevalent conditions among older adults , and recent research suggests that their association may extend beyond the effects of aging alone . An essential instrument for determining the possibility of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is the cardiometabolic index ( CMI ) , a new lipid based index sensitive to visceral obesity . However , little has been established about the relationship between CMI and AAC . We examined CMI and AAC data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) conducted in 2013 2014 for this study . The relationship between AAC , severe abdominal aortic calcification ( SAAC ) , and CMI was assessed using multiple linear and logistic regression models . The overall trend was visualized using smoothed curve modeling . Subgroup analyses were conducted to find possible moderating factors . Among the 2704 participants included , those with higher CMI levels exhibited much greater AAC scores and a higher prevalence of SAAC . In model 3 , elevated CMI positively correlated with AAC ( 25 ( 09 , 41 ) ) and with the odds of SAAC ( OR = 35 ( 09 , 67 ) ) . Participants in the highest CMI quartile had an AAC score that was 65 units higher ( beta = 65 ( 26 , 04 ) ) and an 114% higher risk of SAAC ( OR = 14 ( 29 , 54 ) ) . Subgroup analyses indicated sex and smoking status significantly modified the relationship between CMI , AAC , and SAAC , while previously diagnosed with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) and heart attack significantly moderated the association between CMI and AAC . These results imply that greater AAC scores and a higher risk of SAAC are linked to heightened CMI , which represents visceral fat storage and disturbed lipid metabolism . Our findings indicate that CMI is correlated with AAC in certain demographic and cardiovascular subgroups , suggesting its potential as an exploratory indicator of elevated AAC risk in these populations .
Breast cancer is a complex and challenging disease to treat , and despite progress in combating it , drug resistance remains a significant hindrance . Drug combinations have shown promising results in improving therapeutic outcomes , and many machine learning models have been proposed to identify potential drug combinations . Recently , there has been a growing emphasis on enhancing the interpretability of machine learning models to improve our biological understanding of the drug mechanisms underlying the predictions . In this study , we developed a random forest model using simulated protein activities derived from Boolean modeling of breast cancer signaling pathways as input features . The model demonstrates a moderate Pearson ' s correlation coefficient of 40 between the predicted and experimentally observed synergistic scores , with the area under the curve ( AUC ) of Despite its moderate performance , the model offers insights into the interpretable mechanisms behind its predictions . The model ' s input features consist solely of the individual protein activities simulated in response to drug treatments . Therefore , the framework allows for the analysis of each protein ' s contribution to the synergy level of each drug pair , enabling a direct interpretation of the drugs ' actions on the signaling networks of breast cancer . We demonstrated the interpretability of our approach by identifying proteins responsible for drug resistance and sensitivity in specific cell lines . For example , the analysis revealed that the combination of MEK and STAT3 inhibitors exhibits only a moderate synergistic effect on MDA MB 468 due to the negative contributions of mTORC1 and NF kappaB that diminish the efficacy of the drug pair . The model further predicted that hyperactive PTEN would sensitize the cells to the drug pair . Our framework enhances the understanding of drug mechanisms at the level of the signaling pathways , potentially leading to more effective treatment designs .
Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT 2 ) inhibitors have been increasingly recognized for their potential neuroprotective properties . Nevertheless , their effects on intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) are still debated , with the precise mechanisms involved remaining unclear . Recent studies indicate that these inhibitors might lower ICH risk through anti inflammatory mechanisms . This study analyzed genome wide association study ( GWAS ) data from individuals of European ancestry , focusing on the relationship between 92 inflammatory biomarkers and ICH . A two sample , two step Mendelian randomization ( MR ) approach was used to examine the potential connection between SGLT 2 inhibition and ICH , as well as to investigate whether inflammatory biomarkers mediate this relationship . Genetic proxies for SGLT 2 inhibition were determined based on variants linked to the expression of the SLC5A2 gene and levels of glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) . Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess the associations between SGLT 2 inhibition , inflammatory biomarkers , and the likelihood of ICH . The genetic prediction of SGLT 2 inhibition was found to be inversely related to the risk of ICH ( OR = 152 ; 95% CI = 066 352 ; P < 001 ) . Out of the 92 inflammatory biomarkers examined , 33 showed a significant association with SGLT 2 inhibition . Notably , levels of IL10 receptor subunit beta ( IL10RB ) were significantly correlated with both SGLT 2 inhibition and ICH . Moreover , IL10RB accounted for 167% of the total mediation effect of SGLT 2 inhibition on ICH . The findings of this study suggest a link between SGLT 2 inhibition and a decreased risk of ICH , with IL10RB emerging as a possible mediator . This presents a potential new strategy for ICH prevention and intervention . Further studies are needed to clarify the role of inflammatory pathways in the connection between SGLT 2 inhibition and ICH .
Alzheimer ' s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by two hallmarks : amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles . The receptor for advanced glycation end products ( RAGE ) is a multi ligand receptor involved in the pathophysiology of various diseases including cancer , diabetes , cardiovascular diseases , and Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) . Therefore , targeting RAGE could be an effective strategy to block RAGE signaling pathways . The present study aims to identify potential RAGE inhibitors against AD through comprehensive in silico approaches . A total of 708 , 580 compounds were screened from numerous databases using structure based virtual screening and ADMET evaluation . Further , the molecules with good glide scores were assessed by molecular docking studies . Subsequently , the top six ligands were subjected to molecular dynamic ( MD ) simulations for 100 ns and binding free energy calculations to check their stability with RAGE ( PDB : 6XQ3 ) . The per residue decomposition analysis revealed that specific residues namely , GLY_20 , ALA_21 , LYS_39 , GLU_50 , LYS_52 , ARG_98 , GLN_100 , LYS_110 , ASN_112 , and ARG_198 played a key role in the binding process . Furthermore , the trajectory analysis ( DCCM and PCA ) analyzed the dominant motions of residues and predicted the stability of protein ligand complexes . In conclusion , the Hit 6 compound could be a promising candidate for targeting RAGE and deserves further consideration as an anti Alzheimer drug .
As a progressive fibrotic lung disorder with high mortality , pulmonary fibrosis ( PF ) suffers from inadequate treatment options . While the traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) formulation Huaxian Formula ( HXF ) demonstrates multi target therapeutic potential against PF , the identity of its active components and their mechanistic basis of action require systematic investigation . To elucidate the therapeutic effects and pharmacological mechanisms of HXF in treating PF induced by nickel oxide nanoparticles ( nano NiO ) , utilizing network pharmacology ( NP ) , molecular docking , as well as in vivo and in vitro experiments . A comprehensive analysis of authoritative databases identified 121 active compounds , 202 potential therapeutic targets , and 1664 PF related genes . Among these , 105 overlapping targets were found between HXF and PF . Gene Ontology ( GO ) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) analyses identified the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway as both a pivotal mechanism in PF pathogenesis and a primary target of HXF ' s therapeutic effects . Molecular docking studies revealed that the six core compounds ( quercetin , luteolin , kaempferol , beta sitosterol , isorhamnetin , and formononetin ) of HXF exhibited strong binding affinity to proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway . In the rat and A549 cell model , HXF treatment reduced collagen deposition and downregulated the expression of type I collagen ( Col I ) . Mechanistically , HXF inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT . Collectively , these findings suggested that HXF alleviated PF by modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway , providing valuable insights and methods for the development of TCM for PF .
Perioperative neurocognitive disorder ( PND ) is a long term perioperative complication that affects elderly surgical patients . As the aging population continues to grow , the prevention and treatment of PND have become important issues to address . Research has shown that ulinastatin significantly reduces the incidence of PND in elderly patients undergoing various types of surgery , including spinal and abdominal surgeries . However , the underlying mechanisms of this effect remain unclear . Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 ( TRPM4 ) is a Ca2 + activated , monovalent cation channel associated with many neurological diseases . In the present study , we aimed to investigate the relationship between ulinastatin and TRPM4 in PND and to determine its underlying mechanism . Forty eighteen month old male Sprague‒Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups : the sham group , surgery group ( internal fixation of tibial fracture ) , ulinastatin group ( ulinastatin + surgery ) , and 9 phenanthrol group ( TRPM4 channel inhibitor 9 phenanthrol + surgery ) . The neurocognitive function of the rats was detected using the Y maze and new object recognition ( NOR ) tests . We used WB , qPCR , and IF to detect the expression levels of TRPM4 in different groups of rats . We also detected the degree of apoptosis in rat hippocampal cells . Surgery under inhaled sevoflurane anesthesia induced cognitive impairments and elevated the expression of TRPM4 in the hippocampus . Downregulation of TRPM4 expression by ulinastatin or 9 phenanthrol alleviated cognitive impairments after anesthesia and surgery . Furthermore , ulinastatin treatment decreased the level of apoptosis in the hippocampus . Ulinastatin downregulates TRPM4 expression and apoptosis to mitigate cognitive dysfunction in aged perioperative neurocognitive disorder rats , and ulinastatin is a promising neuroprotectant against PND .
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease , this study aims to investigate the immune landscape in carotid atherosclerotic plaque formation and explore diagnostic biomarkers of lactylation associated genes , so as to gain new insights into underlying molecular mechanisms and provide new perspectives for disease detection and treatment . Single cell transcriptome data and Bulk transcriptome data of carotid atherosclerosis samples were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) . Eleven cell types were identified by scRNA seq data . Lactylation scores were significantly higher in gammadeltaT cells than in cells of other subtypes , but lower in plasma cells than in cells of other subtypes . The scores of malignant related pathways were significantly increased in cells with high lactylation scores . scRNA seq combined with bulk seq identified differentially expressed lactylation genes in carotid atherosclerosis . A diagnostic model was constructed by combining 10 machine learning algorithms and 101 algorithms , SOD1 , DDX42 and PDLIM1 as core genes . Further analysis revealed that the expression levels of core genes were significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration , and their regulatory networks were constructed . Clinical samples verified that the expression of core gene in unstable plaque was significantly lower than that in stable plaque , suggesting that it has protective effect on atherosclerosis . By combining scRNA seq and Bulk transcriptome data in this study , three lactylation associated genes SOD1 , DDX42 and PDLIM1 were identified in carotid atherosclerosis samples , providing targets for the diagnosis and treatment of carotid atherosclerosis samples .
Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder driven by genetic predisposition and environmental exposure . Given its well documented antioxidative and neuroprotective properties , resveratrol is increasingly being considered for its potential to counteract the neuronal damage characteristic of Parkinson ' s disease . Here , we investigated the therapeutic action of resveratrol in a transgenic Drosophila melanogaster model expressing human alpha synuclein ( SNCA , PD flies ) , in combination with network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses . The PD flies were fed diet supplemented with resveratrol ( 15 , 30 , and 60 mg/kg diet , approximately 57 , 14 and 28 mM , respectively ) , to evaluate lifespan . This was followed by a 21 day treatment of PD flies with similar concentrations of resveratrol in the diet to evaluate cognitive function , oxidative stress , and antioxidant biomarkers , using Levodopa ( 1 mM ) as positive control . The results showed that resveratrol supplementation in the diet significantly improved lifespan , locomotor activity , acetylcholinesterase and catalase activities , and thiol content compared to untreated PD flies . Furthermore , resveratrol reduced nitric oxide ( nitrite/nitrate ) , malondialdehyde , and total hydroperoxide levels , and enhanced cellular metabolic activity and upregulated Sod1 mRNA expression ( p < 05 ) . The network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses identified key molecular targets that may account for the therapeutic action of resveratrol , including B Cell Lymphoma 2 , Monoamine Oxidase ( MAO ) ; in flies , MAO Like , Dopa Decarboxylase , Protein Kinase A and Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 ( GSK 3 ) . Among these , MAO and GSK 3 emerged as top targets as indicated by network prominence and strong binding interactions . Additionally , the binding interaction of resveratrol to SNCA at specific sites suggests a potential role in inhibiting its aggregation , which is a hallmark of PD pathology . Quantum mechanics calculations revealed that resveratrol functions as both a proton donor and acceptor , contributing to its strong target binding interactions and antioxidant potential . Overall , resveratrol supplementation in the diet may be beneficial for PD management by modulating dopamine metabolism , apoptosis , oxidative stress , and cell survival . The study provides valuable experimental and computational insights into the underlying therapeutic mechanisms of action of resveratrol and supports its potential use in PD management .
Altitude training is a method among endurance athletes to enhance performance via hypoxia induced adaptations . However , individual responses vary significantly , with some athletes even showing performance decrements . Iron metabolism and immune function may influence these adaptations , as hypoxia induced erythropoiesis increases systemic iron demand , potentially affecting immune cells reliant on iron . This study investigated the interplay between hematological , iron , and immunological variables under controlled normobaric hypoxia . 15 highly trained athletes participated in a 21 day live high train low training camp in a normobaric altitude house . Blood samples were collected pre and post camp and at four intermediate time points to measure hematological variables , iron metabolism variables , and immunological variables . Pre and post performance was assessed via VOmax tests . Statistical analyses included paired t tests , Wilcoxon rank sum test , Spearman correlations , and Granger causality analysis to explore systemic temporal interactions . VOmax increased significantly ( p < 05 ) with large interindividual variability ( 4 +/ 5 ml/min/kg ) . Hemoglobin concentration , erythrocytes , and the soluble transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) showed significant increases over time ( p < 05 ) , while ferritin peaked early and declined post camp . Myeloperoxidase and lactoferrin exhibited dynamic correlations with iron variables ( p < 05 ) , reflecting competition between erythropoiesis and immune function for iron . The structure of the Granger causality network places transferrin in a central role , highlighting iron metabolism as one key regulator of these adaptations . Normobaric hypoxia training induces systemic physiological changes involving hematological , iron , and immune systems . Controlled hypoxic conditions enable detailed exploration of these interactions , providing insights into optimizing altitude training strategies for endurance performance enhancement .
Personalized cancer vaccines elicit robust T cell immunity and anti tumour potency , but identifying tumour specific antigens remains challenging , severely constraining the therapeutic window . Biomimetic nanovaccines employing cancer cell membranes display inherent biocompatibility and stimulate T cell responses against diverse tumour antigens , though tumours develop multiple mechanisms to reduce antigen presentation . Here we demonstrate a rapid and general strategy to fabricate personalized nanovaccines based on Antigen Enriched tumor Cell Membranes ( AECM ) for early intervention . Interferon gamma potently stimulates antigen presentation across a broad range of cancer cell types . By coupling the generated AECM with PC7A adjuvant , a stimulator of interferon genes ( STING ) activating polymer , the AECM@PC7A nanovaccine induces robust poly neoepitopic T cell responses even at low dosage , achieving significant tumour regression and metastasis inhibition in multiple murine cancer models . This anti tumor response relies on MHC I restricted antigen presentation and CD8 ( + ) T cell activation , with dendritic cells presenting AECM antigens predominantly via cross dressing to prime T cells . AECM@PC7A exhibits remarkable anti tumor efficacy when compared to vaccines with diverse formulations , and demonstrates therapeutic potential in post surgical and humanized xenograft tumor models . This proof of concept study provides a promising universal avenue for the rapid development of personalized cancer vaccines applicable to early intervention for a broad range of patients .
Pathophysiological mechanisms of unhealthy aging , particularly the transition from robustness to frailty , remain poorly understood . Despite extensive microbiome research on taxonomy , the behavior of early prefrail gut bacteria in their natural community host mucosal tissue context remains unexplored . Using fecal samples from the INSPIRE T aging human cohort , we characterized gut microbiota phenotype during prefrailty stages using a polymicrobial biofilm model . Results revealed that prefrail derived biofilms exhibited distinct taxonomic and physical alterations , enhanced dispersal , and increased epithelial virulence compared to robust counterparts . Multiparametric analyses linked biofilm characteristics to clinical traits , suggesting their potential as aging status indicators . Polyphenol rich grape pomace extract partially reversed prefrail biofilm alterations and reduced proinflammatory prefrail biofilm responses in vitro . Microbiota from prefrail aged mice induced colon damage in antibiotic treated recipients , establishing a prefrail microbiome inflammation causality . Overall , the findings identified novel prefrail microbiome characteristics , established causal inflammatory links , and supported microbiota targeted geroprotective interventions for the prefrail populations .
Chimeric Antigen Receptor ( CAR ) T cell therapy is a pivotal treatment for hematological malignancies . However , CAR T cell products exhibit batch to batch variability in cell number , quality , and in vivo efficacy due to donor to donor heterogeneity , and pre/post manufacturing processes , and the manufacturing of such products necessitates careful testing , both post manufacturing and pre infusion . Here , we introduce the Cell Trajectory Modulation ( CTM ) assay , a microfluidic , label free approach for the rapid evaluation of the functional attributes of CAR T cells based on biophysical features ( i . e . , size , deformability ) . CTM assay correlates with phenotypic metrics , including CD4 : CD8 ratio , memory subtypes , and cytotoxic activity . Validated across multiple donors and culture platforms , the CTM assay requires fewer than 10 , 000 cells and delivers results within 10 minutes . Compared to labeled flow cytometry processing , the CTM assay offers real time data to guide adaptive manufacturing workflows . Thus , the CTM assay offers an improvement over existing phenotypic assessments , marking a step forward in advancing CAR T cell therapy manufacturing .
High throughput massively parallel reporter assays ( MPRAs ) and phenotype rich in vivo transgenic mouse assays are two potentially complementary ways to study the impact of noncoding variants associated with psychiatric diseases . Here , we investigate the utility of combining these assays . Specifically , we carry out an MPRA in induced human neurons on over 50 , 000 sequences derived from fetal neuronal ATAC seq datasets and enhancers validated in mouse assays . We also test the impact of over 20 , 000 variants , including synthetic mutations and 167 common variants associated with psychiatric disorders . We find a strong and specific correlation between MPRA and mouse neuronal enhancer activity . Four out of five tested variants with significant MPRA effects affected neuronal enhancer activity in mouse embryos . Mouse assays also reveal pleiotropic variant effects that could not be observed in MPRA . Our work provides a catalog of functional neuronal enhancers and variant effects and highlights the effectiveness of combining MPRAs and mouse transgenic assays .
Neuronal activity driven mechanisms influence glioblastoma cell proliferation and invasion , while glioblastoma remodels neuronal circuits . Although a subpopulation of malignant cells enhances neuronal connectivity , their impact on the immune system remains unclear . Here , we show that glioblastoma regions with enhanced neuronal connectivity exhibit regional immunosuppression , characterized by distinct immune cell compositions and the enrichment of anti inflammatory tumor associated macrophages ( TAMs ) . In preclinical models , knockout of Thrombospondin 1 ( TSP1/Thbs1 ) in glioblastoma cells suppresses synaptogenesis and glutamatergic neuronal hyperexcitability . Furthermore , TSP1 knockout restores antigen presentation related genes , promotes the infiltration of pro inflammatory TAMs and CD8 + T cells in the tumor , and alleviates TAM mediated T cell suppression . Pharmacological inhibition of glutamatergic signaling also shifts TAMs toward a less immunosuppressive state , prolongs survival in mice , and shows the potential to enhance the efficacy of immune cell based therapy . These findings confirm that glioma neuronal circuit remodeling is strongly linked with regional immunosuppression and suggest that targeting glioma neuron immune crosstalk could provide avenues for immunotherapy .
Transcriptomes provide highly informative molecular phenotypes that , combined with gene perturbation , can connect genotype to phenotype . An ultimate goal is to perturb every gene and measure transcriptome changes , however , this is challenging , especially in whole animals . Here , we present ' Worm Perturb Seq ( WPS ) ' , a method that provides high resolution RNA sequencing profiles for hundreds of replicate perturbations at a time in living animals . WPS introduces multiple experimental advances combining strengths of Caenhorhabditis elegans genetics and multiplexed RNA sequencing with a novel analytical framework , EmpirDE . EmpirDE leverages the unique power of large transcriptomic datasets and improves statistical rigor by using gene specific empirical null distributions to identify DEGs . We apply WPS to 103 nuclear hormone receptors ( NHRs ) and find a striking ' pairwise modularity ' in which pairs of NHRs regulate shared target genes . We envision the advances of WPS to be useful not only for C . elegans , but broadly for other models , including human cells .
Kinases regulate cellular processes and are essential for understanding cellular function and disease . To investigate the regulatory state of a kinase , numerous methods have been developed to infer kinase activities from phosphoproteomics data using kinase substrate libraries . However , few phosphorylation sites can be attributed to an upstream kinase in these libraries , limiting the scope of kinase activity inference . Moreover , inferred activities vary across methods , necessitating evaluation for accurate interpretation . Here , we present benchmarKIN , an R package enabling comprehensive evaluation of kinase activity inference methods . Alongside classical perturbation experiments , benchmarKIN introduces a tumor based benchmarking approach utilizing multi omics data to identify highly active or inactive kinases . We used benchmarKIN to evaluate kinase substrate libraries , inference algorithms and the potential of adding predicted kinase substrate interactions to overcome the coverage limitations . Our evaluation shows most computational methods perform similarly , but the choice of library impacts the inferred activities with a combination of manually curated libraries demonstrating superior performance in recapitulating kinase activities . Additionally , in the tumor based evaluation , adding predicted targets from NetworKIN further boosts the performance . We then demonstrate how kinase activity inference aids characterize kinase inhibitor responses in cell lines . Overall , benchmarKIN helps researchers to select reliable methods for identifying deregulated kinases .
Post translational SUMO modification is a widespread mechanism for regulating protein function within cells . In humans , SUMO conjugated proteins are partially regulated by the deconjugating activity of six SENP family members . The proteolytic activity of these enzymes resides within a conserved catalytic domain that exhibits specificity for the two primary SUMO isoforms : SUMO1 and SUMO2/ SENP5 , along with SENP3 , are nucleolar proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and preferentially target SUMO2/3 isoforms . Here , we present the crystal structures of human SENP5 in complex with both SUMO1 and SUMO2 isoforms . These structures reveal a minimal complex interface and elucidate the molecular basis for SENP5 ' s preference for the SUMO2 isoform . This preference can be attributed to a basic patch surrounding SENP5 Arg624 at the interface . Swapping mutagenesis and structural analysis demonstrate that Arg624 is favorably oriented to interact with Asp63 in SUMO2/3 , while its interaction with the equivalent Glu67 in SUMO1 is less favorable . These results suggest that subtle structural differences within SUMO isoforms can significantly influence their deconjugation by SENP enzymes , opening new avenues for exploring the regulation of SUMOylation in various cellular processes and for developing therapeutic agents targeting SUMOylation pathways .
The microbiome is key to understanding endometrial cancer ( EC ) etiology and prevention strategies , implicated in the regulation of estrogen in estrogen driven cancers . Utilizing robust methodologies in the QIIME 2 platform , we examined 16S rRNA vaginal and rectal microbiome data from an EC cohort : 192 women with benign gynecologic conditions , endometrial hyperplasia , or endometrial cancer . Distinct microbial compositions and community networks specific to EC were identified and related to histological grade with adjustments for EC risk factors . Vaginal health associated Lactobacillus and Limosilactobacillus , and rectal Prevotella and Peptoniphilus , were depleted in EC , while detrimental vaginal Anaerococcus , Porphyromonas , Prevotella , Peptoniphilus , and rectal Buttiaxella were enriched . Significant bacterial features were shared between rectal and vaginal sites in EC , such as Prevotella timonensis and Peptoniphilus A . Vaginal Lactobacillus abundance contributed to less feature sharing from the rectum . Putative microbial metabolic analysis identified dysregulation of amino acid , complex carbohydrate , and hormone metabolism amongst patients with EC .
Hepatic ischemia‒reperfusion injury ( HIRI ) occurs during liver surgery , contributing to postoperative complications such as liver failure , prolonged hospital stays , and increased morbidity and mortality rates . Yet , the mechanism underlying HIRI remains unclear . Nicotinamide N methyltransferase ( NNMT ) facilitates the conversion of nicotinamide into N methylnicotinamide ( 1 MNA ) and plays crucial roles in various pathophysiological processes . In this study , we find a decrease in hepatic NNMT expression and serum 1 MNA levels during HIRI . Both NNMT overexpression and exogenous 1 MNA treatment alleviate HIRI in male mice HIRI models and primary hepatocytes H/R models . Mechanistically , NNMT/1 MNA plays key roles in inflammation , apoptosis , and vascular injury during HIRI through the AKT/FOXO1/ANGPT2/JNK axis . Hepatic specific depletion of NNMT leads to increased ANGPT2 expression and exacerbates HIRI , effects that can be mitigated by ANGPT2 knockdown . Our findings suggest that NNMT/1 MNA/ANGPT2 may regulate HIRI via the JNK signaling pathway . In summary , we present the function of NNMT and its underlying mechanism in liver injury , providing potential new therapeutical strategies for addressing HIRI .
Norepinephrine ( NE ) , a pivotal neurotransmitter in the central and sympathetic nervous systems , is crucial for numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes . Distinguishing NE from structurally similar dopamine and epinephrine in complex in vivo environments is a significant challenge . Herein , we propose a molecular docking strategy for selective , sensitive , and ultrafast detection of NE in vivo . Leveraging the molecular structure of NE , we design a Zn single atom modified TiO substrate ( Zn/TiO ) as a photoelectrochemical ( PEC ) biosensor , providing synergistic atomic anchoring sites to " lock " NE molecules and enabling real time NE detection in the brain of living male mice with a response time of 60 ms . The high specificity and rapid detection capabilities of this biosensor have unveiled a regulatory mechanism of the noradrenergic system across multiple brain regions , including the locus coeruleus , cortex , and hippocampus , highlighting a synergistic effect during epilepsy . This rationally designed single atomic PEC biosensor for in situ monitoring of neurotransmitter dynamics holds promise for future brain science research .
Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is the most prevalent vaginal condition among reproductive age women presenting with vaginal complaints . Despite its significant impact on women ' s health , limited knowledge exists regarding the microbial community composition and metabolic interactions associated with BV . In this study , we analyze metagenomic data obtained from human vaginal swabs to generate in silico predictions of BV associated bacterial metabolic interactions via genome scale metabolic network reconstructions ( GENREs ) . While most efforts to characterize symptomatic BV ( and thus guide therapeutic intervention by identifying responders and non responders to treatment ) are based on genomic profiling , our in silico simulations reveal functional metabolic relatedness between species as quite distinct from genetic relatedness . We grow several of the most common co occurring bacteria ( Prevotella amnii , Prevotella buccalis , Hoylesella timonensis , Lactobacillus iners , Fannyhessea vaginae , and Aerrococcus christenssii ) on the spent media of Gardnerella species and perform metabolomics to identify potential mechanisms of metabolic interaction . Through these analyses , we identify BV associated bacteria that produce caffeate , a compound implicated in estrogen receptor binding , when grown in the spent media of other BV associated bacteria . These findings underscore the complex and diverse nature of BV associated bacterial community structures and several of these mechanisms are of potential significance in understanding host microbiome relationships .
At advanced phases of atherosclerosis , the rupture and thrombogenesis of vulnerable plaques emerge as primary triggers for acute cardiovascular events and fatalities . Pathogenic infection such as periodontitis associated Porphyromonas gingivalis ( Pg ) has been suspected of increasing the risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , but its relationship with atherosclerotic plaque destabilization remains elusive . Here we demonstrated that the level of Pg positive clusters positively correlated with the ratio of necrotic core area to total atherosclerotic plaque area in human clinical samples , which indicates plaque instability . In rabbits and Apoe ( / ) mice , Pg promoted atherosclerotic plaque necrosis and aggravated plaque instability by triggering oxidative stress , which led to macrophage necroptosis . This process was accompanied by the decreased protein level of forkhead box O3 ( FOXO3 ) in macrophages . The mechanistic dissection showed that Pg lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) evoked macrophage oxidative stress via the TLR4 signaling pathway , which subsequently activated MAPK/ERK mediated FOXO3 phosphorylation and following degradation . While the gingipains , a class of proteases produced by Pg , could effectively hydrolyze FOXO3 in the cytoplasm of macrophages . Both of them decreased the nuclear level of FOXO3 , followed by the release of histone deacetylase 2 ( HDAC2 ) from the macrophage scavenger receptor 1 ( Msr1 ) promoter , thus promoting Msr1 transcription . This enhanced MSR1 mediated lipid uptake further amplified oxidative stress induced necroptosis in lipid laden macrophages . In summary , Pg exacerbates macrophage oxidative stress dependent necroptosis , thus enlarges the atherosclerotic plaque necrotic core and ultimately promotes plaque destabilization .
DNA polymerase gamma ( POLgamma ) , responsible for mitochondrial DNA replication , consists of a catalytic POLgammaA subunit and two accessory POLgammaB subunits . Mutations in POLG , which encodes POLgammaA , lead to various mitochondrial diseases . We investigated the most common POLG mutations ( A467T , W748S , G848S , Y955C ) by characterizing human and mouse POLgamma variants . Our data reveal that these mutations significantly impair POLgamma activities , with mouse variants exhibiting milder defects . Cryogenic electron microscopy highlighted structural differences between human and mouse POLgamma , particularly in the POLgammaB subunit , which may explain the higher activity of mouse POLgamma and the reduced severity of mutations in mice . We further generated a panel of mouse models mirroring common human POLG mutations , providing crucial insights into the pathogenesis of POLG related disorders and establishing robust models for therapeutic development . Our findings emphasize the importance of POLgammaB in modulating the severity of POLG mutations .
